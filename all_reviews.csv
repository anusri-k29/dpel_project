My children loved the pool and the kids club.

I loved the cleanliness and friendly staff.  Nothing is too much trouble.  Special mentions should go to Maria (front of house), Saniya and Jannick (hospitality team) who were fantastic with my children and made us feel very welcome and Chef Naushad and Chef Pritvi who patiently helped us on a daily basis with my daughter's severe nut allergy. Thank you guys!

,5,,Wonderful hotel in a beautiful beach,"This newly renovated hotel looks amazingly beautiful. In particular, the garden is a gem with diverse plants. Some areas seemed redone and plants need further growth, but the area with established trees and flowers are so nicely designed and the pond linked with the pool area is lovely.

The Flic en Flac beach itself is picturesque. The sea is shallow for swimming or snorkeling, so it‚Äôs important to check and wait for the high tide. This long beach was better for a hike. For swimming, we mostly used the pool. The adult pool is beautiful and calm. There are plenty of beach chairs on the beach and around the swimming pools.

All restaurants and bars look posh and provide foods and drinks of high quality at reasonable prices. The hotel offered a variety of live music and performances for lunch time and evening entertainment. I particularly loved to listening to lovely songs mixed with the sound of waves at the bar next to Les Coquillages. 

The spa is under reconstruction so sauna and steam room are not expected to be around until end of December 2023. Massages were available in two designated guest rooms with massage beds or on the beach. I preferred the  one on the beach. 

Staff members were welcoming,  friendly and helpful. 

There are wild life such as lizards, birds, frogs and cats. Don‚Äôt get scared by the frog chorus in the evening. Unlike European ones, they stop singing around midnight. And according to our search they help controlling mosquitoes. On rainy days and in the evening, baby frogs can hop around, so mind your steps.",COUPLES,30-11-2023,Hilton Mauritius Resort & Spa,1,hilton resorts (mauritius)

We were repeatedly ignored and not served at the beach bar, although the bar was almost empty and there were enough staff. Long waits for food and drink at the beach bar. Food in the buffet restaurant not exactly varied. Every day almost the same buffet with only minor changes, although the buffet has a different theme every day. Chairs and loungers dirty with bird droppings and it is not cleaned. Drinks ordered without ice, but served several times with ice. Teapot was served, but without cup. Latte macchiato was served in a tall glass, but with a short spoon, the ordered latte macchiato for breakfast was a different coffee every day, etc. Although complaining at a high level, everything should not be at a 5 star hotel and the travel price. Otherwise beautiful grounds for a relaxing holiday. Maid Malini of Suite 1002 was very nice and friendly.",COUPLES,31-10-2024,Hilton Mauritius Resort & Spa,1,hilton resorts (mauritius)

Service: 1",Unwelcoming and disappointing,"I recently visited with my family, expecting a relaxing day and a nice lunch. Unfortunately, from the moment I arrived, I felt policed and restricted. I was informed that I could only eat at the restaurant and that all other amenities, including the kids' club, were off-limits because the hotel was full. Strangely, when I went to see the kids' club, it was completely empty. I thought it would be okay to let my children enjoy the space for a moment. Management thought it wise to tell us to leave citing ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù as the reason.

Given that the kids' club was empty, they could have been more accommodating. The unwelcoming attitude and rigid approach made the experience anything but relaxing. I usually don‚Äôt leave reviews, but this visit left me so displeased I felt compelled to share.",FAMILY,31-10-2024,Hilton Mauritius Resort & Spa,1,hilton resorts (mauritius)

Sleep Quality: 5",Luxurious resort with everything you need on site,"From when you arrive at the resort you are treated very well with helpful staff in beautiful surroundings. The rooms are spacious with all you need and balconies. The balconies do vary from room to room, some are covered, others are open and some are a bit of a mix! They do need to spend a bit of time checking the maintenance of the rooms, the light system seems overly complex and doesn't work all that well, some switches are loose, one party in our group couldn't turn a bedside light off without turning off all the lights for example. Our room had a loose toilet seat and the shower amenities fell off the wall.
The rest of the resort was fantastic, pools were lovely plenty of bars, deck chairs did get busy around the pools but there were always some on the beach. The beach was very clean and super clear water in the lagoon for snorkeling. There were water sport activities including sailing, paddle boards wind surfing and pedalos. You could also borrow reef shoes, fins and snorkels (although they were full face snorkels that have been shown to be dangerous and you shouldn't dive under the water with).
We did have one meal at the beach front restaurant which we weren't that impressed with, food didn't come out together, wasn't hot and some portions were very small. The hotel can help with taxis into the town were there are loads of options or you can walk down the beach about 30mins, be warned it might be hard to get a taxi back at night though! 
Breakfast was a good spread with plenty of options, my wife wasn't a fan of the machine coffee served so you can ask the staff for a proper coffee from the barrister upstairs.
Would certainly stay here again should the opportunity arise and could maybe try the Indian or Thai restaurants.",FAMILY,30-09-2024,Hilton Mauritius Resort & Spa,1,hilton resorts (mauritius)

Nairobi,5,,Exceptional service from the Hilton family,"I‚Äôve gotten out of the habit of leaving  reviews, only exceptionally good or bad experiences seem to warrant the time. 

We stayed at the Hilton as a family, and I have to commend the management and the team for their ability to maintain excellent service levels everywhere. 

From the second you walk in, you are warmly greeted, slowly being ushered into what will be a worry free stay. 

We spent a couple days at the Hilton, food was always good and selection was ample. Touch you have to book the specialty restaurants in advance for dinner, we were always able to get our choice within 24 hours. 

The facilities were great. As I understand it, the hotel seems to have undergone a renovation program during COVID. As such, everything seems relatively new, and most importantly, enriching just works. 

The location worked well for us as we were able to do quite a few activities all within in 25 minute drive.

I booked one of these rooms by calling the Pension telephone number. I was in Barcelona and my interlocutor didn‚Äôt know the Inn.
When I arrived obviously, I did not have the room booked. 
On the other hand I was amazed by the carpeted hallway full of stains and the worn walls. The room at the height of the hallway , carpet unstuck, the whole very tired. I wonder how the Accor Group could let this Sofitel get so filthy. There are breaches of trust , already the Reservation , then the quality of the Inn which no longer corresponds to a Sofitel . Too bad because the location is superb , but frankly , you have to dare to rent rooms in this condition. The director agreed to this by giving me a 50% discount.

Sleep Quality: 5",Wow Wow Wow,"What a trip!
We checked into the Atlantis for a 4 night stay, half board. 
Upon arrival, our bags got taken from up and said they would be put in our room upon check in time. 
We checked in and were given Waterpark tickets as we couldn‚Äôt enter our room until 15:00. Check in was pretty smooth and was given refreshments. 

When we could check in, our room keys were handed over to us and yes, our luggage was in the room ready and waiting. I had paid for an arrangement to be done as it was my partners birthday. ‚ÄòHappy Birthday‚Äô was on the bed in rose petals, with a towel animal which was the cutest, with a cake and card! This was so pretty. 

Our room was amazing. Looked over the aquarium, Atlantis Royale, Atlantis Balloon, in the skyline you could see the Burj Al Arab and Burj Khalifa, it was perfect. 
The room itself was amazing. Big comfy bed and pillows. Lots of storage. TV, mini bar, iron, safe. Big bathroom with free standing bath and amenities. 
The perfect touch was we were turned down every night, slippers at the side of the bed. Glass and water on the bedside table. Pillows and duvet ready. We were even given little gems to go on our chargers. And they tied up the bathroom.

With the hotel stay you get the aquarium tickets included, the aquarium is amazing. Lots of different fish and more to see. Rheymaria at the aquarium spoke to us reguarding a few of the animals which were in the aquarium, showing us skeletons and pieces of the animal, which we could touch and hold. She really made the time to speak to us. 

There are many dining options to choose from night. Whether you choose the buffet option, half board dining option which included a 3 course meal including soft drink or you could pay a supplement charge for some restaurant. We did a mixture of all 3 over our stay. 
Definitely recommend Seafire for a romantic steak night. En Fuego is amazing for its atmosphere and the decorations inside. This is South American themed. 
We also visited The Shore for a tex mex theme, this was one of our favourites. 
We liked to eat at Saffron for breakfast. It was light and airy. Had a nice feel to it. 

A few bars to drink at in the evening. We visited Arabian Terrace, this was a lovely, quiet vibe. 

There is also a cafe located on the G floor of the hotel which sells pastries and sandwiches, with a view of the aquarium. 
If you like a milkshake and ice cream, head to Cold Stone. The milkshakes are unreal!!!

The beach and pool are both amazing. Lots of sun beds at  both, with a towel ready on your bed. You can order food and drink on the app or press the buzzer and the waiter/waitress will take your order from the bed. There are many water fountains located at the beach, pool and water park. 
Watersports are available. Unfortunately it was too hot for us and we didn‚Äôt make use of this.

The water park is just amazing. Lockers and towel are available, lockers at a small charge should you wish to rent one. Aqua socks come as complimentary. Photographers around the pools and slides to capture special moments. There is a golf cart which goes around the park if you get too hot walking. Lots of food outlets. 

Lots of shops on site. From designer brands to food and keep sakes. There is a little market also on the ground floor for keepsakes, perfume/aftershave. Jewellery. 

The monorail can be reached from the hotel. It was really cheap for us to get to the Nakheel Mall and they run every 10-15 minutes. You also get good views of the palm whilst onboard. 

We got engaged whilst out in Dubai, and the hotel was amazing.
We were given a box with chocolate strawberries, macaroons and chocolates in the room with a cake.  
Each restaurant we went to they celebrated our engagement with a cake. They really make it special for us. 

I would go back tomorrow if I could. It was the most amazing experience which I didn‚Äôt want to end. I hope to be back in the future.

My son is at an age where he's too old for kids club and won't relax on the beach for long so we finally took the plunge with the water park in mind and booked Atlantis for the October half term. We travelled as a family of 4 and took the overnight flight from the UK which arrived early in the day. Check-in was good and a room was immediately ready. This was good although we did need to pay for breakfast that morning. We had booked on a HB basis. Rooms exceeded expectations. I imagined that they may look dated considering the age of the hotel but I couldn't have been more wrong. The Deluxe/standard room was easily big enough and felt luxurious. We ate breakfast in Saffron each morning which we felt was much nicer than the other buffet restaurant. We tried the Lebanese and Mexican restaurants then also tried Saffron a couple of times at night. They were all superb and I feel that the dining options and quality of food and service rivals that of the Jumeirah - Madinat dine around. The two huge swimming pools were never over crowded. My son enjoyed playing water basketball each day and obviously, access to the waterpark was a huge hit. The new section of the park which connects the residents of The Royal is called Tridents Tower. It has all the latest slides and family rides and is great fun (even for someone who doesn't normally like water parks!) The early access to the park is a big bonus as it gets very busy with non-resident guests as the day goes on. We enjoyed hanging out and around the hotel in the evening, looking in the shops and staring at the aquarium for ages. The gym is good but my only criticism of the hotel is that the gym could be a lot bigger with more equipment. Free weights in particular. It did get very busy in the mornings. I think that considering it would cost a family of 4, ¬£300 waterpark entry and ¬£150 lost chambers aquarium entry, considering all - A stay at Atlantis is good value for money. Its great fun too! Location is really good. Easy to get on and off the Palm and the monorail connect the hotel - 1 stop away to the Nakheel mall which is also worth a visit. Especially the tower.

It was three nights, before they got to the beach, by the pool comfortable, relax straight. At the water park, the queues aren't as big as at antlantis, there are a couple of coasters worth standing. Not all the restaurants have hit yet, there's a reason to come back.

Sleep Quality: 1","Terrible holiday, do not recommend this hotel","Relaxed in this ""miracle"" hotel from 30.09. to 07.10.2024. It's just a terrible vacation. From the beginning. The airport checked in quickly, with children at a separate counter. On the bus, the guide gave him water, that's about it. Yes, the hotel itself looks respectable, a large room, with a large bed, there fit three. When they arrived at 5:00 p.m., the dining room was closed, they said it would open at 7:00 p.m. We could arrange some sort of ala buffet for the guests. They tried to find out where the restaurants were, but at the reception only nothing was explained and had to look for themselves. Eventually they found a pizza place, where a small pizza cost 2500 r. The food is just terrible, no you will not starve to death, but everything is monotonous, after 4 days the children demanded meat, went to restaurants, but the prices here are not small, by comparison fruit (3 peaches, 3 mandarins, a pack of grapes, strawberries and mangoes) cost 4000 r. Let's go on, from the pool and the sea the guards kick out (exactly kicks out) at 1800, by the pool lounge is just terrible, not even music, but just drum bass, is not possible there, to requests to change music neither the bartender nor the manager responds, around the hotel there is construction, dust, dirt, noise. And the cherry on the cake, I had it all on, although I don't drink alcohol, but took it as a convenience so the kids could have any soft drinks. And so at the end of the vacation, I met the fellow countrymen, decided to buy a beer, took a can, just one, and handed it to a comrade, the bartender ran up, ripped out and threw the can on the ground, and I was forbidden to go near the bar. It's like I paid the money and I can't exercise my right, because I didn't get a case of beer and other alcohol and sabotage there. So Turkey is much better, and we don't have that in Krasnodar Krai. I'll try Dubai next time and if that's what it is, we'll cross the Emirates, but this hotel is not like five stars, there's not even two stars to put up for.

Kolkata (Calcutta),5,,The Crown of IHCL Which is a Must Visit for Every Indian ,"Me and my wife revisited the Taj Mahal Palace,Mumbai in June this year to celebrate our Engagement Anniversary and rejuvenate some old memories.We recently completed our all India trip in which we travelled across the entire country for 1.5 years,and gathered knowledge and experiences about various tourist attractions and countless 5 star properties.We had stayed in all major palaces,resorts and hotels owned by taj,Oberoi and Leela in India including Falaknuma Palace,Umaid Bhavan Palace,Rambagh Palace,Lake Palace,Udaivilas,Amarvilas,Rajvilas,Leela Udaipur,Leela Delhi,Jai Mahal Palace and many many more.Many GMs and area directors of Taj had become our well wishers and friends across this journey and have throughly helped and assisted us across taj property bookings and queries..

When it comes to Taj Mahal Palace,Mumbai it holds a special place in our heart as our first trip of our all india tour started with this hotel,in September 2022.We had got impeccable service and noteworthy hospitality from the staff and management which made that stay a dream come true.I recall Mr Arzaan Billimoria(their former front office manager ,now shifted to other brand)being always there for us and assisting us at every point.So at May,when our trip got completed,we shortlisted a few properties across India that we wanted to revisit another time,before heading home and Taj Mumbai topped that list.This stay was with a lot of expectations for my wife as she was very excited for this stay.I wanted to inform the property in advance about our arrival,and also wanted to request a few things to be added to our reservation.I wrote to Mr Ritesh Sharma with all the details and our requests and also informed the ihcl management regarding this stay.I got replied by Mr Ritesh the following day,who upgraded our room to an executive suite,agreed to add 4 pieces of laundry to our booking which I requested as due to travel our clothes were soiled,agreed to a celebration dinner from their side once during the stay.He also shared his direct number for any assistance.We were happy with the prompt reply understanding how efficient the gm was.He also told us he will give special price for airport pickup but didn't tell the exact price.After 2 days I got a mail from Taj Conceige requesting our time of arrival and flight details to arrange the car,and shared the special car rate(4000 plus tax)which was a 20% discount from regular rate.But as outside cars are more cheaper and knowing I will get an Uber for 1000 rs from airport to hotel,I declined the offer.At the day of arrival,few hours before boarding the flight,when we were sitting in the airport,we got a call from Mr Mayank Babla(front office manager)who said they will arrange a car for 2500 rs instead of 4k to which we said we will take it but 2.5k should be inclusive of taxes as I was reluctant to pay tax on already increased rate.He agreed to this and our car was arranged.When we arrived in Mumbai,we saw the airport manager of Taj and our chauffeur holding a placard of Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai,standing outside the airport.They quickly took our luggage and guided us to hotel car(Innova type).The journey from airport to the hotel was seamless and the chauffer was friendly and very well mannered.Upon reaching the property,we were made to enter from a separate gate(palace entry gate situated a bit away from the main gate)with Mr Babla standing in front to receive us and a front office executive who was holding a folder with our reservation details.Mr Babla quickly guided us to the main palace reception where a quick traditional welcome was given to us and then we were escorted directly to our room.It was 343.Mr Babla accompanied us and he also made us meet Mr Dhananjay Chaurasia(Their butler manager -who was my one point of contact throughout the stay),their deputy housekeeper who assured of good service during our stay and then Mr Babla left us to get settled.Someone from ird brought welcome drinks to the room.I had requested some amenities to be preplaced in the room during my booking(extra bottles,towels,dental kits,soaps etc)and I was overjoyed to see each item I requested,was placed in the room in the exact order.There was also a hand written card from Mr Ritesh Sharma,the gm in our room.Mr Ritesh Sharma shortly called us and enquired whether everything was alright or not and that he hopes we like the room.His personalised service and attention added a special touch to our stay.After resting for a while,we went to the palace lounge to have high tea(Palace lounge access was also included in my booking)The lounge is located in lobby floor,and it's unique feature was that across all the times of day,it had some snacks and soft drinks and hot drinks available.From 3 to 5 they call it high tea,from 5 to 8 it is cocktail hours and so on.and at all other times of day,hot and cold beverages are available.There is an extensive buffet of snacks, sandwiches,dry fruits,cakes,pastries for guests to snack on and indulge in.We enjoyed the snacks throughly and everything tasted great.My wife ordered a cold coffe and me a green tea.The servers were friendly and attentive.After this we went to explore the entire property and click some pictures and videos of it.There we were met with our first hurdle.While I was taking some videos of the lobby,some staff and security came rushing to me asking us to stop shooting and that it is not allowed.I was pretty disturbed as wherever we went,we take videos of the the place to keep them as a memory with us.However this was sorted quickly with a quick call to Mr Babla who made an exception for us and let us do the videos.It felt quite nostalgic to roam around the historic property and we explored the spa area(located next to tower reception, beautiful ambience and a peaceful vibe throughout),taj salon(located across the shopping arcade),their all day dining restaurant Shamiana(located at lobby level),Lebanese restaurant Souk(located at rooftop of taj towers,you will get magnificent views of Mumbais Skyline from there),their harbour bar and the Chinese restaurant Golden Dragon.The property is very well maintained exactly similar to the time we last visited,and they do daily heritage walks complimentary for taj tower and palace guests to help the guests discover the history of the palace.There are a group of palace historians for this purpose.

After exploring the entire property,it became very late for us to venture out and we returned to our room.The room was nicely cleaned while we were away,and turndown service was also done.I ordered a chicken burger from in room dining for dinner,which was delivered within half an hour and tasted pretty amazing.I also had to clean our washroom at night once and when I requested it,a very polite hk manager called Mr Ishwar came along with 2 staffs to complete it quickly.

The next day I ordered food from swiggy for lunch.As we usually stay at 5 star properties,we have to control our budget a bit and I generally prefer outside food over hotel food(can be eaten once or twice during stay,but spending on it daily will extinguish our budget)and I had requested Mr Sharma to allow swiggy food to be delivered to the room.Last time I was here,this practice was not there and outside food was completely banned.This time however I noticed they are allowing outside food but guests needed to come down to main gate to collect it.I was no exception and same was applicable to me as well.For that day and next couple of days,I ordered food from swiggy multiple times and each time it was a hassle to cross all those elevators,walk all the way across from palace reception and lobby and go to main porch to collect it.But the hassle was worth it as we were staying in an iconic property and the experience made up for the hassle.For all other requirements during the day,like hk service,plates cutleries etc from ird I just had to text the butler manager and he delivered everything swiftly across to our room.We left to visit Jio World Plaza that day and upon returning enjoyed the night view of taj and the pool at the swimming pool area.

At night they run a light and sound show kind of thing at the pool which creates a dreamy ambience there.The guests like it very much and we also enjoyed it thoroughly.The 2nd day also passed in a hppy note.The 3rd day was the day of our engagement anniversary and the staff beautifully decorated the room with designer balloons and also arranged a happy anniversary chocolate cake for us.Mr Sharma personally wished us as well and we decided to eat the complimentary celebration dinner they extended to us that day.

Also I wanted to see once all the other categories of rooms and suites present in the property and also at Taj Mahal tower.Palace had some signature suites and also the iconic Tata Suite(most expensive presidential suite in India costing 20 lakh plus taxes per day).I was promised to be shown all that after we arrive from the Mumbai tour in the evening.In the evening one of the front office lady,escorted us and we saw one basic room(grande luxury city view),one luxury suite,one signature suite Ravi Shankar and another suite Rajput Suite(made of all white marble,the best suite among all) and also their signature tata suite (651).The tata suite spans a vast area of 4500 sq ft and it the most iconic suite we have ever seen in our life.Won't get into details for privacy,but every penny spent on staying that suite is worth it.After the showround was complete,I was guided to the Golden Dragaon restaurant by their f and b manager Mr Rashid(who was working previously at Taj Falaknuma where we met him few months back).We took a table at windowside and ordered a bunch of starters and main courses from their extensive menu.Meanwhile,some managers came and handed us a flower bouquet and wished us happy anniversary.The bartender customized a special mocktail for my wife which she throughly enjoyed.The starters (baby corn,dimpsums,dry chilli chicken)were lip smacking and we tasted such delicious Chinese food after a very long time.The main courses(Fried rice,Kumpao chicken and prawn)were equally delicious as well and we cherished each one of them.This will last as a memorable dining experience for us which we will remember and cherish for a long time.

The last 2 days of the stay also passed seamlessly.Only drawback was me having to go to main porch to collect the food,rest everything was in perfect order.Every request of ours,was handled by Butler manager Mr Dhananjay who did a splendid job(never had to call palace services, everything was taken Caren of Dhananjay,just had to ping him in WhatsApp),gm was just a call away for any assistance (helped us multiple times).Hk was doing a perfect job of room upkeep,and night requests being handled by Mr Ishwar who is a very good person in hk department we saw.We also went to taj lands end once,to explore the property and Mr Sharma arranged everything personally so that we get a seamless experience.We had dinner once at sea lounge the 5th day,which also went pretty well,with friendly servers and impeccable service (Mr Rashid comped our mocktails and my green tea).Food quality and taste is well maintained in the property and price is also in line with other 5 star properties.

Another noteworthy thing was the Heritage walk that we wanted to do.Upon informing Mr Sharma,he arranged the best historian of the palace,Mr Newton D' Souza (his name is mentioned in many past tripadvisor reviews as well)for us to personally give us the tour.He is a very friendly, elderly gentleman in his early 60s who had worked in taj mumbai for 30 plus years,got retired and became the palace historian.He is also a painter(a reputed one,his paintings sell in lakhs as we got to know)but he and his family follows their role model the tata group and donates most of the money in charity.He started the tour from the Palace reception,covered the grand staircase,history of the palace and tower and many many more minute details which I won't spoil here,if you take the tour you will experience it yourself.He is a gem of a person working in the property,and i can assure every guest,if you take a tour with him,if will become a memory of a lifetime for you.

At our checkout date,the gm arranged breakfast for us as we had to leave early and also arranged a car to get us dropped to the next property we will be staying.Mr Sharma also came to meet us personally, enquired about the stay,we clicked picture with him and other managers then escorted us and our luggage to the car and bid goodbye to us.The stay ended in a very happy note and made our revisit quite memorable and very much worth it.

And last but not the least,if you want to stay at this signature taj property but still hesitating questioning the value for money prospect,let me highlight some noteworthy points which will make your decision easy-

1) Upgrades-The property being the first taj in India,and emotion for every Indian,the taj group understands and caters to it.Upgrades are provided generously,ie if you are celebrating a special occasion and inform them in advance,you can get upgraded from basic room to a sea view room or even a suite if you are lucky enough.They also upgrade people who come first time to Mumbai or staying at the property first time,to add to their delight.This is all of course subject to availability.

2)Staff Behaviour-While ihcl manages many many more palace properties in India,the royal palaces(rambagh,umaid bhavan etc)are all leased from their respective royal families and not owned by taj.This one on the other hand,is under ihcls sole ownership and their first hotel.Only the best of the best employees and manager are allowed to work here who work tirelessly for guest delight and comfort.The behaviour you will get here,will be the best among all other tajes present in India.

3)Taj Tower-Newly built,is more like a modern city hotel.The prices start at 10k,which is super low compared to taj mahal palace,But guess what,they sometimes upgrade you from tower to palace if rooms are available(atleast 15k price difference).This is a very crucial factor as they offer upgrades from budget to luxury at no extra cost.If you are lucky,who knows you can get this as well(mentioned in multiple last reviews).

4)Value for Money Prospect-Rooms start at Palace for 18k,which is pretty decent when you combine the service standards, luxury and ample space in the rooms(even the basic room starts at 400 sq ft),and when you combine the Heritage factor with all that,it's an absolute value for money prospect.(All other palaces of taj have rooms that start from atleast 35k while taj has kept prices low for this one for all people to be able to afford).    

5)Shared Amenities-If you book at tower,ie a room for 10k,you can still enjoy all facilities of the palace.The spa is the same for both tower and palace,pool is also the same(central main pool shared between guests of both properties).You can also have access to taj palace lounge if you request.and also access to all the restaurants in the property.

6)The Management-Everyone I came across,from Mr Ritesh Sharma,Mr Babla,Fom of the towers,Assistant gm evryone was polite,humble and very much guest friendly.The management works tirelessly for guest delight and amusement and all minute details are taken care of.If any issues occur,they are solved immediately.

Special thanks to Dhananjay,Mr Ishwar from HK,Mr Newton,Mr Ritesh Sharma whom we can't thank enough for everything he had done for us from those upgrades to personally being always there for us when we needed him the most(we used to call him everyday during the stay for queries).We hope to return again soon in the future.Until then,all the best.",COUPLES,30-06-2024,"The Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai",10,taj mumbai  (india )

Last year they offered a really fun Summer series which was a different activity
everyday.  They had a putting contest, wine tasting and a pickleball clinic when we
were there.  They eliminated this.  

Last year each night they had a different menu and the food was very good.  Now
the menu was the same each night and the food was mediocre and service
was very slow.

Add to that a total lack of amenities in the cottage and I think Rosewood should
carefully consider what they are eliminating.

Service: 5",Poor value proposition ,"For $5800 per night we certainly expected more than was delivered. We had just arrived after 3 nights from their competition in Russell which way over delivered at a third the price. 

The room:  we booked a two bedroom unit with the understanding we would be upgraded. Well, it turns out we had already booked the highest category and    they couldn‚Äôt upgrade to next level because it was full of employees of the new company Rosewood that is taking over. 

The layout was poorly designed. To get to the primary bathroom from the primary bedroom you had to exit the bedroom and go through the common hallway. Who thought that was a good idea?

I bent down to tie my shoe on our third day and saw a belt sticking out from under the bed. It didn‚Äôt belong to us. Which means for three days at least the house keeping staff had missed it. Gross. 

There were only three towels in the bathroom so when you get caught in a rain storm and need to dry off (we did) there weren‚Äôt towels to use for showering with after. 

The food: so bad our first night that instead of going back to the property for lunch after our excursion we looked around for any alternative.  We didn‚Äôt find anything so had lunch at Kauri Cliffs and it was reasonable. Dinner that night was significantly better than the first night. 

The service:  everyone seemed to be trying hard but with the exception of the true professionals like Sebastian (food and beverage manager) and James (guest services) they really didn‚Äôt get what five star service should be.

What we loved.... 1) being greeted on arrival, car parked and our bags transferred to our suite while we sipped bubbles and had a tour of the main house and facilities, 2) Pre-dinner canapes and set course dinner, 3) recreation room, cigar room and games room, 4) location - views, and opportunity to walk through the paddocks, 5) privacy - was almost full but didn't bump into many people at all and 6) the food - top notch. 

What has stopped me giving it 5 stars.... upon arrival at the suite the Sky TV wasn't working. We spent far too much time trying to sort it.... didn't work so went to ring reception but the phone wasn't working either! Gas fire seemed to be faulty but got it working. The TV and phone was attended to with an apology, but as we had spent lots of time on this it would have been nice to have been given a free drink or  similar.

,2,,"If the ""Laird"" is on premises, stay away because you don't count","So my wife and I did a trip in October and November of 2022 to Australia and New Zealand.  It was awesome.  Out travel agent booked us at the best lodges including the One and Only in the Wolgan Valley near Sydney, Qualia Resort near the Great Barrier Reef,  Azur lodge in Queenstown and Huka Lodge Taupo.  Everyone one of these was a unique and special experience and I would rate each one as Excellent.  HOWEVER, one of the lodges was Wharekauhau Country Estate.  This should have been another outstanding experience, but the US ""Laird"", who had not been to the lodge in over a year was there with the board of his company, Fidelity National Financial. Clearly they should not have booked anyone, or any common folk like me, who is not a Billionaire or board member.

From the beginning we were an after thought.  Dining in the main hall, nope Bill and and the board were there.  Ability to do any of the activities on the menu, not really as Bill and the board were partaking of all of these.  Asking us what we wanted to do the next day when we checked in, nope, since they knew there was nothing they could accommodate, why ask.  Well that did not stop me and my wife and I were lucky enough that one of the staff folks could take us to a near by village to wander around while he went home and had lunch with his wife.  Cost to take my wife 25 miles to the town, $500.   Dinner that night was again not near the Laird and Board, but in a different private area.  To add final insult to injury when paying $1250/nite, I was charge a credit card fee when I used my visa.  I guess that's how the rich get richer.  
My whole experience, wha incredibly poor. I shared all of this real time with my Virtuoso travel agent and she tried, but at that point I did not see the property manager again.  Either he was too embarrassed to share the truth or our bad timing or was too busy serving the Laird.  In either case stay away.  While a nice property and great location, unless you are an equal of the ""Gods"" or want to get nickeled and dimed, there are many more outstanding resorts and places to see.

(Special thanks to Audrey, Adrian, Nicholas, Jacki, and Yvette for making our three-night stay a memorable one.) One day we drove into Wellington and sent to the main museum and took a cable car to the top of the hill and walked around the botanical gardens a bit, and one day we drove to the lighthouse and seal colony and then followed up with lunch and wine tasting in Martinborough.  We also took some walks around the property including a walk along the bluff overlooking the ocean, and made sure to enjoy some quiet time reading in the lodge.

All of the staff here were amazing and they made my stay extra special!

If you have access to breakfast or the club, you‚Äôll find the most patient and attentive staff.

We were here for 9 nights and every breakfast and club was bursting at the seams and there were a lot of rude guests, but the staff here handled everything with grace and a smile.

While the entire staff here was amazing, there were a few standouts.

When there wasn‚Äôt plant-based milk for coffee, Heba helped order soy milk for my partner because she is plant-based/vegan.  We were pleasantly surprised she would go through the hassle for us and even let us know when it arrived.

When my partner couldn‚Äôt find plant-based food, Queenie came out with samosas and daal that were vegan and weren‚Äôt available in the main self-serve area. 

Carol told her what she could eat and was super helpful when navigating the buffet.  Carol was the warmest, most nurturing chef we‚Äôve ever come across.  She was very patient and was happy to accommodate any dietary restrictions in a way that felt like she truly cared about our well-being.  

The service here was phenomenal.

It‚Äôs usually difficult for my partner to find plant-based milk for her coffee and good plant-based food when we stay in Hyatts or other hotels.

In some cases, they make it feel like a burden or we would simply get a ‚Äúno‚Äù when we asked for these things.

However, the staff at Hyatt Regency Dubai went out of their way to get soy milk, prepare plant-based/vegan food, and also ask the chefs what was vegan to make sure she didn‚Äôt accidentally consume butter, ghee, or milk.

The location is in the business bay which is located near the airport and burj khalfia. It is central but you have to get taxis everywhere, we used Careem a lot. 

The only negatives I have is my GHD wireless straighteners went missing, we did ask management and house keeping but no where to be seen. I had an emergency and was rushed away by ambulance and ever since that day I think housekeeping could have accidentally binned them but hotel couldn‚Äôt say.

,3,,Communication,"So this is my first visit  any of the Hilton Hotels. I had a problem with an inactive link online for parking. Also I was confused about who I was meant to ring to ask questions. I had two numbers and eventually someone answered.
While I was there staff were very welcoming. The process was easy to get to my room. But I was told I didn‚Äôt have to use my card to go down but not that I had to use it between all the floor. I had to ask and found other clients were helping me and I was helping them to use the lifts.
The room was very nice but no labels or a list on what all the buttons around the room were for. Both my family member unintentionally open that blind over the shower. Without fully understanding what blind was. I could only hear a small noise while I had a shower. A small poster explaining what blind does would take care of that. Because I have never seen a  room shared blind on shower.
In regards recovers to asking for a handful of uht milk.The lady forgot to put milk in the fridge because anhe didn‚Äôt listen to what I said at the start.After having three conversations with people. Two times to the same reception person and one to the female host of the restaurant staff who promised a handful of milk would come up to our room.
My mum likes coffee and wasn‚Äôt well which why she was in her room during your hotel cleaning time. 
The young blond guycontacted I‚Äôm guessing housekeeping. The second time when I started to speak and say I had been there two times he cut me off and said I had been there once. This is not how customer service is conducted. You say how may I help you and be prepared to listen. Tell them what has happened. Then offer to take action. And let them know that you are sorry again and that the information will be passed on to housekeeping, hospitality department and management. Then the customer should be contacted by management and either offer something in the way of an apology or let the customer know all the actions that have been taken. I think was 3.5 hours it took to resolute this issue and receive the milk. And no follow up was done. I have worked within this industry and know how hard people work. But the communication in person and through online documentation needs to be fixed and reviewed. I also don‚Äôt how my mum would cope with all your digital reliance as she has no computer skills.

I had slight reservations about the area, but far from feeling threatened, I had the best selection of nice restaurants, bars and cafes and was on the doorstep to great museums.

The rooms are modern and have great amenities, lots of charging points and comfy beds. Good coffee machines and a fridge. 

Breakfast was fantastic with a different selection each day and the host made such an effort to make you feel welcomed and to check up on you when you approached her each morning.

Reception staff on both stays were really helpful and were accommodating to my early check in and late check out requests. Much appreciated due to the weird flight times I somehow managed to book.

Pool area great for relaxing by. Didn‚Äôt get to visit the gym as I had a lot of tours booked (they all offer hotel pick up) from the Doubletree.

However, it‚Äôs location leaves a lot to be desired as it is opposite a massage parlour, peep show venue and a couple of sex shops.
It is also surrounded by nightclubs.

Our problems started on our second night when the room was physically vibrating to the music from a nearby nightclub.
I went down to reception at just after midnight to find out where the noise was coming from and to complain to the night staff.
The music continued until 5am so we got no sleep whatsoever.

I complained again in the morning and was told it would be passed on to the day manager.

Despite clearly explaining that we were out for the day and uncontactable, the Guest Relations Manager sent me an email message during the morning with a deadline of midday to decide if we wanted to move rooms or transfer to their sister hotel.
I did not physically receive that email until we returned to the hotel later that day.

We then spoke to duty manager, Amy Tran, who was absolutely terrific.
She explained our choices and personally helped us move all our belongings to a new room.

Like many places in Europe, the rooms tend to run on the small side - but it's Paris for Gawd's Sake, so how much time are you going to spend in the room anyway?  The staff are downright incredible:  Jean Claude, Miriam, Melanie, Wilfred at night - all of them - are downright terrific.

I was able to get in email contact with the hotel very easily and the staff were wonderful in answering my questions and helping to make my stay perfect. I arranged to be collected at the airport and the gentleman who picked me up (and dropped me off when leaving) was very friendly and helpful. The friendliness and helpful ways of all the staff continued throughout my stay and I‚Äôd like to say a particular thank you to Myriam. I was given a room on the ground floor which was lovely; the room and ensuite were a good size, well furnished and decorated.  The only small problem I had was there was no grab rail to hold onto going down the 2 or 3 steps in the sunken bath to have a shower so, being nearly 80, I had to be very careful when having a shower. Breakfasts were good and I particularly enjoyed the fresh croissants.  The hotel is close to the banks of the Seine, 10 minutes walk from the Eiffel Tower and has a few restaurants close by. There is a nice little bar in the reception area, and a lovely little courtyard outside my room, where I enjoyed few quiet gin & tonics during my stay.

Sydney,5,,Elevated experience with a cosy feel,"I have to admit that Capella Sydney wasn't on my radar when it comes to high-end hotel properties until recently. I sincerely apologise for my oversight.
We had a staycation there a little while ago and it was a most pleasant experience. What stood out for us is the service and the cosy feel. This is not a boutique hotel but it is certainly smaller than a lot of properties within walking distance of the Circular Quay.
While the staff are not high touch, you have the feeling that you are being looked after. They are always professional and courteous.
The property is housed in the former Department of Education building which was completely renovated and extended. Capella opened in March 2023 so it is a relatively new hotel. It is a couple blocks back from the harbour so you won't get a harbour view. However, being closer to the business side of the CBD certainly give off a different vibe which is not a bad thing.
While the amenities are modern, you can't escape the history of the site. To wit, they have culturalists on site that will brief you on the history of the nearby area and conduct small scheduled tours of the heritage building and the artworks within. That is quite unique.
We stayed in a Tower King room. It is a well appointed and spacious room made even larger via a couple of sliding doors which opens up the large bathroom. A normal door from the hallway gives you the same access if you want to close the sliding doors.
As you'd expect, all the high-end mod cons are present and well integrated into their ecosystem. However, this is where the little touches make a difference. For instance, my wife's pet hate is not being able to find a set of hotel slippers that fits her. Much to her surprise, she found a small and a large pair in the room and the small pair fits perfectly and are very comfortable. That definitely got a thumb up from her.
Oh, one more thing, the hotel has a proper turndown service. It is more than a mini room service. They also set out a bottle of water and a glass by your bed, both sides. They also move the TV remote to the beside table. Nice touch.
Ok, the elephant in the room. For a room of this standard, why is there no bath tub? I don't necessarily need one but its absence raised eyebrows. A mystery for another stay.",COUPLES,31-10-2024,Capella Sydney,24,capella sydney (sydney) (australia)

The location of the hotel, near Victoria Station, really helped my wife get her bearings as this was her first trip to Eurpe. This location allowed us to jump off to various sites around London. It had conveniant pubs nearby where we got to revist with my cousins. Overall, a terrific vist and excellent stay at the Rubens.

The hotel gave us a nice junior suite , which was very close to the beach as well as close to a small pool. That was just great that you could already take a dip in the sea in the morning before breakfast. The junior suite was very spacious and left nothing to be desired.
The complex is overall very extensive and also has the most beautiful stretch of beach in Le Morne. The view of Le Morne from the beach is incomparable. For joggers, there are great opportunities to walk on the beach as the beach stretches for several kilometers. Everything is very private and quiet. Also the large pool area is great, there is a great fitness area and a kids club that is open from morning to night. 
The breakfast was great , rich and varied and left nothing to be desired. We also used each of the restaurants at least once for dinner (Japanese/Thai/Indian/Buffet Mauritius style as well as steaks and seafood on the beach) and we were not disappointed once. Great food and also priced perfectly fine. We especially loved the teppanyaki at the Japanese restaurant.
The spa was great too, so my wife and I booked 90-minute massages twice each, which were great. Price-wise, the massages for a 5-star hotel were completely within reach.
Overall, the hotel is very generous. The water - even in the restaurants - is always free, there are always free snacks on the beach and there are many activities offered free of charge such as kayaking, snorkeling, etc.
Since we celebrated our wedding anniversary during our stay , the hotel offered 2 bottles of champagne, a delicious cake and canap√©s to the room during our stay. Very thoughtful.

Sleep Quality: 5",Incredible Resort,"The St. Regis Resort in Goa is truly an unforgettable experience. From the moment we arrived, everything about our stay exceeded expectations, and there‚Äôs simply not one aspect I can fault about this exceptional hotel. The combination of world-class facilities, luxurious ambiance, and the unparalleled service of the staff made our vacation magical and memorable.

Every single staff member went out of their way to ensure our experience was perfect. Their attention to detail and genuine hospitality created an atmosphere where we felt valued and well taken care of throughout our stay. Nothing was too much trouble, and they consistently went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. The level of service we received here is the gold standard, and I would confidently recommend the resort to anyone. In fact, I‚Äôm already looking forward to planning our next visit!

A standout highlight of our stay was the dining experience. Chef Kevin deserves a special mention. He was incredibly accommodating, happy to tailor-make any dish to our preferences, and consistently delivered food that was simply divine. His creativity and dedication to flavor made each meal a delight, and the freshness of the ingredients was evident in every bite. Beyond that, the restaurant staff, including Diksha, Naro, Puji, and Dharmendra, were exceptional. Their service was impeccable, always delivered with genuine warmth and grace. They not only made our meals seamless but also added a personal touch, engaging in friendly conversations that made us feel right at home. Their hospitality is something we will always remember fondly.

Another charming aspect of the resort was the delightful surprise of the rabbits that roam the beautifully manicured grounds, lovingly looked after by Hari. Watching these rabbits added a playful and calming element to our walks around the property, making the atmosphere even more special and serene. Hari‚Äôs care and dedication to the animals were truly heartwarming.

The overall property is breathtaking. From its pristine pool area to lush tropical gardens, everything is designed to offer guests a true paradise experience. The rooms were impeccably clean, spacious, and adorned with elegant decor that reflected the culture and essence of Goa. Whether it was enjoying a peaceful morning by the beach or relaxing in the luxurious spa, every corner of the resort offered a new way to unwind and feel pampered.

Lastly, the front desk and reception staff were phenomenal, always cheerful, ready to assist, and quick to answer any questions. Their efficiency made check-in and check-out smooth and stress-free, and they made sure we felt welcomed from beginning to end.

The St. Regis Resort in Goa stands out as one of the best resorts I have ever had the pleasure of visiting. We‚Äôve traveled to many places around the world, but nothing compares to the level of care and service we experienced here. This resort is more than just a beautiful place to stay; it‚Äôs an experience filled with heartwarming hospitality and luxurious comfort that lingers long after you leave.

Our 15 Day stay at St Regis again this year has been phenomenal. The property is beautifully maintained & upgraded. The resort had so many things for us to do. My daughter enjoyed her bicycle rides, exploring the spice garden, feeding the rabbits and geese.

It so homely because of the entire team, beginning with the front desk to the men and lady gardeners who made everything so green and clean. We saw Kingfishers, pond herons, rabbits and so many birds.

It is a Beautiful vast property, amazing for having long walks and clean beaches. We have been coming here since the past decade, every time having a wonderful experience.

 Our Daughter loved all the activities planned by Joshna and the team at the play area. The library had a lovely mix of Indian and foreign authors; books for kids and us, they are all over at the reception, at Manor & kids play area.

On the beach the facilities are very nice. Every evening, we loved the Champagne opening Ritual (especially my dad) led by the Butler team followed by watching the sunset at Susegado and live music. We thank Abhishek & team.
Charan set us up with a fun-filled dolphin ride.

We enjoyed the breakfast and dinner spread at Miri. The staff led by Chef Santosh, Chef Saumya, Chef Kevin had a delicious spread and cater to every need by my family and our daughter. Thank you to Deep, Sona, Manish, Puii, Mang & Elizabeth.

 Thank you to Chef Santosh and Shanker. We loved the seafood prepared by them. It was just as per their instructions. My daughter built such a lovely rapport with both. They are very understanding.
It was nice that the old team members remember us personally during every holiday we visit. Truly appreciate their gesture.

For a day or two there was a heavy down-pour. Buggy driver Patil & Laundry staff Pravin went out of their way to make our time easy & comfortable.

We had booked 3 rooms with 2 Suites. All were properly manicured to perfection by the housekeeping team. We were happy with the turn down team, as in the evening after we are back from the beach, our daughter brings sand and shells everywhere. The team does not leave any sand behind and neatly arranges the shells on the coffee table.

At the Manor, we loved the High tea sessions with the spread of snacks and cocktails. I would just request that the high tea menu is changed on a routine basis. Umanand entertained us with stories about the property and we could share our old memories of our frequent holidays during Leela days. Divyesh, Akriti and the entire chef team at Manor - thank you for fulfilling my daughters‚Äô wishes.
We loved the experience of having quick bites at the Food truck by the pool. Kheya and Manjit entertained us.

Lastly, I cannot finish without a BiG Thank you to Jonathan, Deblina & Charan who went Above and Beyond to accommodate us with everything that we needed and made our long stay as comfortable as possible. Each and every request was dealt swiftly and resolved.
It was a Pleasure to once again spend time with Satish, Amit & Apoorv. Your staff made our stay memorable.

Sleep Quality: 5",A wonderful St Regis experience!,"My wife & I visited this wonderful property in oct 2024. This used to be a Leela property earlier. I had seen the You Tube videos of its leela days, and aboslutely abhored the dated decor! But once I came to know that this property has been taken over by Marriott & that too under the St Regis umbrella, I did some research and booked their newly renovated deluxe room. And I was vindicated by the wonderful new decor of the room, classy, subtle and mild on senses. Excellent shower, bath tub and service. Comfy mattress and a feeling of being in world class service of Marriott.
When we reached here on Sunday, the brunch was in progress and we joined in. It was fabulous! The spread was amazing. And the everything was delicious. The best restaurant is MIRI and the staff here is just outstanding. The breakfast was sumtuous everyday! The host that I really liked was Naro. She is so welcoming! Always smiling and never imposing. Shubhodeep @ their beachside restaurant was amazing as well. He listened so patiently to what we suggested and then arranged a fabulous Tiger Prawn in butter garlic sauce for me, and a special on demand chicken chettinad with Goan rice for my wife. Both of us felt extremely pleased. Manish @ MIRI was another extremely pleasant young man, with great customer service capabilities. All in all, the staff @ this very well managed property is top notch!
Now some important points! The property is still being renovated, and they do it phase wise, without any noise. So it will take some time for whole property to be ready. Just take any of the newly renovated rooms and You will be OK. The Riverside restaurant is a let down! Its a hall converted to a restaurant and there is no feeling being in a proper fancy restaurant, the decor needs to change here bigtime. The shower, changing facilities @ the pool are abysmal.
In conclusion, I usually visit South Goa once or twice a Year, and everytime we stay @ Taj Exotica. This was the first time we came here & it was just because of the St Regis takeover. And I am certain we will be back here many more times. The wonderful beach, the confluence of the river & ocean, the riverside view, the excellent rooms, the wonderful staff @ MIRI and the fact that this is already a very well managed property will keep bringing us back!",COUPLES,31-10-2024,The St. Regis Goa Resort,31,st. regis goa (india)

New Delhi,2,,Undoubtedly substandard property of Marriott Hotels Chain.,"I've been a frequent guest of JW Marriott properties and explored many hotels owned by them however this is the first property which didn't met the standard of Marriott.

Our check-in was late i.e., post midnight, I  requested for a upgrade or lounge access but it was denied by Kaushal at reception desk. 

He didn't even bother to check on the system and straight away denied our request.

We already mentioned to make sure that we get room at non-smoking area however while entering our alloted room, We could sense unusual smell, which seems to be of nicotine or ciggerates.

Bedsheets had multiple black lines & spots which are easily visible.

Tiles inside room entrance were not clean & could see yellow patches.

While I was going outside to report issue at reception desk, I saw blue packet which seems to be garbage and it was kept just outside our door.

These things were noticable within 5 minutes of entering the room, which ensures that room was not prepared before alloting it to the guest.

Since we are vegetarians, We request few items to add in breakfast buffet, In all the Marriott properties, staff members were very kind and informed us to notify in advance so that requested items can be prepared by chef.

We did same at JW Juhu, I went all the way downstairs post midnight at the restaurant, requesting the same but our request was not entertained.

So, We requested again during our Breakfast but staff members were not at all cooperative, They didn't even  bother to check with chef and denied it.

Aman Chaurasiya from restaurant was very rude and unprofessional.

We raised these concerns with the restaurant manager Joseph but he was adamant and rigid. He was repeating same lines again and again without listening what we are trying to say. This is the first manager I encountered who has same behaviour like his staff members. 

Later in the afternoon, I spoke with Dushyant who was the duty manager at reception desk, He was sensible enough to listen our concerns and complaints. He acknowledged all our issues and said will escalate it to the Management Team.

Most of the staff members are not hospitable at all however people like Dushyant Singh (Duty Manager) are the ones who are really kind and generous. Seriously take care of the guests.

Dushyant later admitted that if upgrade was not possible then person who was working at the night shift could provided a better room.

Dushyant was very helpful, caring, cooperative, hospitable and supportive. 

He also given few benifits as a kind gesture to compensate the inconvenience caused during our stay.

Thank you so much Dushyant. 

People like Dushyant are not just a staff but an asset to the company.

He was humble, polite & courteous.

Heard all our issues.

A small feedback for the hotel layout, the overall look and design is not good enough if I compare to other JW Marriott properties such as Mumbai Sehar or St. Regis. 

Carpets were old, tiles were not clean, buttons on lift were broken. Overall building seems that it doesn't meet Marriott standards. Apart from that Pool, Beach access, Lobby, Lower lobby and washrooms were nice and clean.

Sleep Quality: 4",Ritz Turtle Bay is Nice but Not Necessary on Oahu,"Was excited to try this property since it joined the Marriott group of properties this year.  Having regularly stayed at St. Regis locations, and having stayed at the Ritz Carlton Waikiki on this same rim, I can frankly say this property is not up to par with what I would expect from a five start resort.  It's location of course is unbeatable, but for value and service, I'd rather be at the Ritz Carlton Waikiki and would certainly skip this property the next time.

Check in went smoothly, if not a little long.  I asked about my suite night award, which I have yet to use this year, and was told there were no upgrades available - but they offered me of course to pay the $150 p/p ($300 a night for my stay) to use the Club Lounge (which would've come included with a suite night award).  Very disappointing to see so little care for Marriott Bonvoy (platinum member) members.  Honestly, they just didn't seem to care.  The club was nice but to be frank, a bit nicer than an airport lounge.  We tried the snacks for breakfast/lunch/dinner and the most bang for your buck is definitely breakfast (though no mimosas or alcohol which is tacky).  Lunch was no more than a United club lounge at an airport, just better presentation.  Some chicken/avocado wraps and spam sushi rolls.  Dinner apps were okay with a great charcuterie spread and wine available.  The biggest issue is the club isn't open all day - for that price, I should be able to get cocktails or sodas anytime of the day.  Super disappointing.  Overal, I don't think we got our $300 value, but if you can drink your share at dinner, you should definitely go for it.  Drinks at the resort at the pool and elsewhere are outraegiously priced and they have a captive audience.

The room itself was unimpressive and did not have the feel of luxury I would expect from this sort of property.  To give an example, that bathroom was very sparse with hardly any toiletry amenities or ""welcome"" towels laid out.  When we checked in at the Ritz Waikiki, the bathroom was fully stocked (including a scale) and had welcome mats in front of each of the sinks, all the high end toiletries and just felt luxe the minute you walked in.  

Service at the hotel was average. It felt like folks were definitely working for your tip as opposed to doing everything to give you an amazing experience.  The Ritz Waikiki was the exact opposite - everyone seemed just fixated on ensuring you were having a memorabe time, tip or no tip. Honestly, the folks at Turtle BAy should be shaddowing the staff at the Ritz Waikiki.  It is night and day for service, anticipating your needs, and just absolute luxury you'd expect.  On top of which, the facilities at Turtle Bay are old.  The patios still have metal grate type balconies as opposed to have clear glass (which provides a nicer view to the ocean).  You also look out at the roof of a large building (towards the ocean) that they haven't even bothered to put grass on or attempt to dress up in anyway.  

Overall loved the location and view but would rather spend my money elsewhere.  Just didn't feel like a Ritz Carlton at all and was disappointed.",FAMILY,30-11-2024,"The Ritz-Carlton O‚Äòahu, Turtle Bay",35,the ritz carlton  (mauritius )

Last time I stayed it wasn't ritz Carlton and I don't see much difference other than price. Thank goodness for Marriott points. Don't know that I would pay $600/ night kamaaina rate.
That being said.....
Room was nice,quiet, and comfortable. View was spectacular.
Lagoon wasn't too busy and jumping in the ocean was just what we needed!
Restaurants on site are good.  Beachhouse was a really good dinner and off the lip a relaxing bar with live music. The breakfast buffet was meh for the price.

And that's exactly what Ritz-Carlton can be paid for on the one hand.....as far as so good, everyone can decide in advance whether the sum called up is also worth it........as long as the service fits. And this is exactly where we have clearly happed. Starting with the check-in, which did not work out at 3 pm, to the suitcases, which were still not there at half past seven in the evening via a double occupancy of our room (suddenly another family was standing in the room). The complex is very nice, however we felt the pool was no longer contemporary. Small and in itself he had little to offer. What I also can't understand is why you don't even get a welcome drink on arrival (at the room rate????!!!!). The kukui nut or shell necklace we got at the reception only over the counter, and were allowed to hang it ourselves............honestly, that does not create any aloha feeling!

Windermere,1,,RITZ brand advocate Dissappinted by changed policy.,"We have stayed here many times and sometimes just visit the beach and then have dinner at Alaia.  We drive over 1hr from Pearl with our son who is in the NAVY there and rent chairs and then enjoy dinner at the resort when not staying on this side at RITZ CARLTON.  But today we have 6 family with us celebrating 2 birthdays at Alaia and came over early to enjoy the beach before dinner and they told us they have CHANGED their POLiCY and now non-guests can no longer rent chairs or umbrellas.  This is narrow thinking for a LUX brand and the wrong answer to frequent guest and restaurant visitor. Disappointed in the RITZ brand, and perhaps why other line Pendry, Auberge and Rosewood are getting better.

We stayed in an Ocean Front Club King room which included access to the Ocean Club Lounge. That Lounge is worth every penny. I highly recommend it. 
The room was spacious and quite clean, well taken care of. 
The beach area was also great, although it needs more cleaning as there was some trash around where the waves broke. The beach is open to the public and if you get there late, you won‚Äôt find a good spot. I also think that it would have been nice if the exclusive area was only for guests and free. That area was frequently empty as no one wants to pay more than what we are already paying for our rooms and also pay for a tiny private area in the beach. The Ocean Club Lounge was great, great food and paid for by the room reservation. It‚Äôs absolutely worth it. 
I really loved this hotel as it was secluded from the buzz of Honolulu. I also hope that now that Marriott acquired this hotel and is called the Ritz Carlton, they continue taking care of it.

This time, I tried Shangri La Hotel which is located on Sh. Zayed Road. This is my first time in this hotel but tried Shangri La before in different cities. The hotel is located in a strategic walkable area with plenty of shops, restaurants, and cafes and its proximity to Dubai Mall. Check-in was so smooth. I was given a wonderful room on the 30th floor facing Sh. Zayed Road. The room has all the amenities that any traveler needs. Extra-things like shaving kit .. etc can be ordered from the reception. The room was of decent size and very clean. The bed was so comfortable for sleep and the room has excellent sound proof. I barely hear anything from outside. The bathroom was also of reasonable size and very clean. I particularly enjoyed their toiletries. The scent is so fresh. The shower has strong pressure which leaves you fresh.  My only issue is that the room has no dedicated USB socket for charging. The breakfast is served at Dunes Cafe in the first floor. It has a variety of options that suits every palate Also this restaurant hosts speciality buffet nights. For seafood lover they have a wonderful buffet on Friday evening. There were suppose to be two restaurants on the second floor but I believe they are under renovation. The first floor has two other restaurants, Chinese (Shang Palace) and Vietnamese (Hoi An) but I didn‚Äôt try them. On the same floor there is the Balcony Bar. Their spa and the outdoor pool are located on the 4th floor, while there is another indoor swimming pool in the 43th or 44th floor (I don‚Äôt remember now!). Both swimming pools are ordinary and the signs of aging clearly is shown on both facilities. I guess the highlight of my stay was the wonderful staff. The staff were friendly everywhere. I particularly remember Kunga at the reception which did everything possible to make my stay very comfortable from smooth check-in process. She was helping me and other customers with a big smile and genuinely she has a great passion in her work. I remember I tried to log-in to my Shangri-La app but for some reason I couldn‚Äôt do that and I needed series of verification without success. I told one of the staff at the reception about this issue and she gave me 1-800 number to dial. However, after 30 minutes I mentioned this issue to Kunga during my check-out process and she managed to call Shangri-La management and within exactly two minutes my app was working again. Overall, nice hotel and I enjoyed every aspect of it. The management has to be proud of their staff.

It‚Äôs near the bus and train stations, shopping areas along Queen Street, and a short walk to the Viaduct restaurants and shops along the waterfront.

We‚Äôve been here for over a week, and it has been a very good stay.

The hotel seems to be in a transition phase. It appears that renovations to the guest rooms are almost finished, as we haven‚Äôt heard much in the way of construction noise, which the hotel‚Äôs website had warned of.

The day after we arrived, the JW Kitchen, which served food in a lobby area, closed, and a new restaurant, Trivet, opened up a stairway just off the lobby. Although the Marriott Lounge serving Marriott elite guests is still closed for renovation, it‚Äôs complimentary breakfast is now being served at Trivet. What a fantastic breakfast spread!! It offers almost everything you could want for breakfast. Although this has been a week of learning for their staff, service was good and food very, very good.

We did order from room service several nights, and the food was high quality. The only glitch was that there was a little difficulty placing a room service order, as most often no one answered the phone at the room service number, and the front desk initially transferred calls to the same unanswered line. But the front desk staff did eventually take the order, if necessary, so it all worked out. And, as I said, the food was well presented and tasty.

Staff were very attentive, friendly, and helpful throughout the stay. When we needed to make a slight change in our reservation, rather than going to the front desk, I emailed the staff person who had responded to an early inquiry before we started our trip. She promptly  made the needed changes without any problems.

Our room, on a low floor, looks out over Albert Street. Not much of a view. But the room has lots of plugs for computers, phones, etc., a small refrigerator, and a safe, which we really appreciate. There are two sets of drawers, but the drawers are all filled with hotel amenities, The bathroom features a large tub and a separate small shower. The shower gets the job done, but is just barely larger than ‚Äútoo small.‚Äù 

 The only thing we had trouble with was the lights, controlled by a set of four rocker switches, and getting the correct combination of lights was frustrating at times.  But that was a small detail in the overall scheme of things.

All in all, we‚Äôve enjoyed this hotel very much, both the service, the room, the restaurant, and the location.",FAMILY,31-08-2024,Jw Marriott Auckland,37,marriott (new zealand )

Overall, I would say it was an average stay and property.  The views were non-existent because of the taller buildings surrounding the hotel.  The hotel in general needs a full renovation and half the rooms are already complete.  No executive lounge currently open but they do provide you with a 4-6pm happy hour and breakfast (both were average).  

My main disappointment was that they didn't tell us about the construction noise prior to booking.  They did give you a sheet upon check in stating that noise could start from 7am to 7pm.  They actually started about 6:15am which was really annoying.  Plus, there is a ton of road construction going on around the property which also adds to the noise.  

We did visit the Park Hyatt, which if I return, I would probably book because it is a newer property with better views right on the water.",FAMILY,31-07-2024,Jw Marriott Auckland,37,marriott (new zealand )

Perth,2,,Never again!!,"Stayed 2 nights and that was more than enough!!

It used to be the old Stamford hotel.  

Beware... The Room walls are PAPER thin. 

First room we checked into we could hear kids screaming & yelling and doors banging.  We had only just arrived, we promptly went down to reception and asked to move to a more quieter location.

The rooms seem to have been updated and were nice.  Not a fan of the uncomfortable bed.  We did hear running one night above us. Short walk to Viaduct harbour.

EVERY time we went to reception there was a LONG line of guests waiting to be served.  This is so unprofessional and totally unsustainable for your staff who were trying their best.

Things not maintained in the room.¬† Couldn't open the door covering the safe, couldn't close toilet door, the flick mixer tap wasn't so flickable it's was more of a force lift and grind.

We came back to our room about 4pm after being out all day, housekeeping were halfway down the hallway our GREEN Light for servicing was still lit up.¬† We dropped our stuff off and went out again.¬† When we came back to our room 6.10pm.¬† Our room hadn't been serviced.¬† As we approached the lift we spotted a staff member and asked if he was housekeeping.¬† We asked if he could clean our room & told him the situation.  NEVER anywhere in the world has our room not been serviced till 6pm!

We then went down to reception to ask to speak with the duty manager and we were told it was the lady behind the counter... We had to queue AGAIN!! 

The housekeeping manager came to see us in the foyer.  We were waiting for the good ole excuse your do not disturb was on and yep in fine form we were told that!!  NO it wasn't we have stayed in thousands of hotels and know how this works! 

This hotel should not be allowed to carry the Marriott brand.

Riverdale,1,,Worst St Regis in the world,"As a Marriott Ambassador, this was a mediocre stay at best, I would recommend elsewhere.
Rooms and location were great, but service was overall lacking and the staff are extremely judgmental.

Unless I was wearing my Sundays finest, I was treated with condescending attitude (all staff) and aggression (security).  No, I was not wearing shorts or tank tops, but simply casual which I prefer when I‚Äôm on vacation or after work. 

Security: I was hounded every time by security as if I didn't belong at the hotel (no, I don't have guests with me, this was a solo trip). I understand the importance of security at a 5 star hotel, however, l've stayed at almost every St Regis in the world and was never treated like a criminal.  Even if they didn‚Äôt recognize me, a simple greeting could do and a smile that I‚Äôm so fond of at the rest of the St. Regis brand. 

After a desert excursion, came back to the hotel and security just stared at me while I opened the door with my hands full. When did St Regis become the Courtyard?

Breakfast: Went two days in a row, barely acknowledged or serviced coffee while other ""rich"" looking folks were treated immediately. Frustrated both days and got up to get my own coffee and was scolded for doing it myself.

Checkout: Staff literally all stared at me while I
carried two suitcases and a bag while I checked out.  After I settled the bill, she just stared at me while l struggled to take my bags to my driver. Again, sorry I enjoy wearing comfortable clothes on a 15 hour flight? I had to correct the bill 3 times, she seemed like she was getting frustrated I was pointing out their errors?! 

Butler made no effort to do anything on this trip as well, don't even know who it was - they should learn from the St Regis in NYC.  

Worst St. Regis I have been to in the world due to poor service and cold staff. This review wouldn't make sense if it was any other hotel, but I paid for a high end hotel expecting top tier service and less judgment. If you're okay with location and decent room, go for it. If you don't want to wear a tuxedo and Rolex every day on your vacation or okay with no personable staff, stay somewhere else.

Staying in the hotel solo, from my first minutes in the hotel I felt at home, my personal satisfaction and comfort their prime objective, with special mention to Butler, Suranga, who provided assistance throughout my stay, always welcoming me by name with a warm smile, happy to answer my questions, nothing was too much trouble. My room was light, spacious and very comfortable with white accents, the luxurious en suite included an ultra relaxing large free standing bath. The breakfast choices are extensive and fully compressive. I enjoyed the fresh half avocado option served with my egg choice and the coffee and beautiful patisserie deserve special mention. The welcoming and attentive restaurant team made a perfect start to my day whether this would be at their infinity pool or out and about at the beach club or elsewhere in Dubai. 
I found the hotel so conveniently located with direct internal access to the Nakheel Mall Dubai Palm and the palm monorail nearby.

My biggest thank you goes to Toshali, the superr supervisor, for fixing my handbag‚Äôs zip while the room was made up & leaving me some bookmarks that I so badly needed! I‚Äôd also like to highlight Sarunga, Pascaline and Lina from the Butlers team and how well they took care of most of my requests (and I have to say I had quite a lot of requests!). Especially Sarunga who learnt my love for desserts & got me the most delicious macaroons & his recommendation of the classic bubble bath & chamomile tea really became the favourite part of my stay! 

Beyond the service which mattered the most to me, I did like the spacious rooms as well. A small improvement could be achieved with adding a beach bag/in house bag for guests to use for the beach/pool and those look pretty good as well.

Sleep Quality: 5",Could have been better,"I recently stayed at the St. Regis Palm Dubai as a Platinum Elite member and received a suite upgrade with beautiful views of Atlantis, which was definitely a highlight of the trip. The butler service was friendly and prompt, but it lacked the warm, personalized touch I‚Äôve experienced at other St. Regis properties. It felt more like standard service than the signature luxury you expect from a St. Regis.

One of the big perks of this hotel is its direct access to Nakheel Mall, which was super convenient for quick shopping trips or dining options.

Now for the not-so-great part: the service was very inconsistent. The staff seemed poorly trained, and if you‚Äôre expecting the seamless, polished service typical of a St. Regis or similar 5-star hotels, you might be let down. For example, housekeeping accidentally took our daughter's soft toy, which wasn‚Äôt a big deal, but getting it back turned into an ordeal. The staff wouldn‚Äôt acknowledge their mistake and made us sign a form stating we lost the item, which was unnecessary and frustrating. A simple apology and maybe a small gesture like chocolates would‚Äôve been more appropriate.

Another weird situation was trying to find out when the family pool closed. We got three different answers from three different people! When we finally made it to the pool with an hour left before closing, we were stopped by a host from the Ruya restaurant, insisting it was closed, even though it wasn‚Äôt. We ignored her and used the pool, but on our way back, she confronted us again. It was strange and uncomfortable‚Äîwhy is a restaurant host policing the pool?

One more issue was with the breakfast allergens. We have food allergies, and not only were the allergens not marked on certain items, but some were marked incorrectly. For example, pastries containing eggs weren‚Äôt labeled for egg allergens. This is a basic requirement at Marriott hotels worldwide, so it was concerning. The restaurant manager did update the labels after we pointed it out, but the initial disregard was worrying.

We did receive an apology from the manager on the last day, but overall, the service and operations here need serious improvement for the price they charge. Honestly, nearby properties like Grosvenor House, though older, offer much better service and make the experience here seem subpar by comparison.",FAMILY,31-07-2024,"The St. Regis Dubai, The Palm",38,st.regis (dubai )

A special thanks to Lydia Fajardo at the executive lounge for making sure we got fed even though we missed breakfast that first day. She and the members of the executive lounge staff were fantastic throughout our stay, and we really felt taken care of.

Housekeeping was always punctual and attentive to our needs. Sunita made us feel right at home. Our room was nicely decorated for my birthday, and a cake was waiting when I returned. It was truly a lovely surprise. My son really loved the towel animals too.

We had a half-board booking and had all our meals at Oceana due to my partner‚Äôs gluten-free needs. The meals were plentiful, and the restaurant staff always made sure my partner had options. Special thanks to Chef Caleb for taking care of our needs and for the special surprise on my birthday! It was an unexpected but highly appreciated gesture.

My only negative would be about the size of the bathroom, which was small and didn‚Äôt have a bathtub. Regardless of this, we had a great time at this hotel and would love to stay there again.

Thank you to everyone who made our stay memorable!",FAMILY,31-10-2024,Hilton Dubai Jumeirah,40,hilton (dubai )

It‚Äôs a little outdated, very much in need of an upgrade inside and it feels dark in the restaurant and surrounds. The rooms are tired as well. Outside is good and the beach area set out nicely. Noisy on the street side where we were and the sports car revving up at 11pm every night is incredibly annoying - not the hotels fault. 
The food was okay in Oceana, lots of variety and amazing puddings! I‚Äôd have liked higher quality and more for children but overall it was okay and catered for all nationalities. The other restaurants were great and we liked the option on our board basis to try them all. 
It was frustrating that you had to go down to the pool so early to get a space, but not sure how the hotel can better handle ignorant holidaymakers who reserved all the beds!
Our room attendant Janaka did a great job and the towel animals and children‚Äôs gift impressed our daughter. 
Esther in Oceana was a welcome smile each morning. In fact, all the wait staff were terrific and everyone great with the kids.

However the hotel is in a perfect location and the beach is amazing. The pool was virtually always in the shade so we did not use, also not many beds round pool for if your watching children.
Food was adequate, nothing to moan about but was not 4star, was basic and think we expected more. The limited set included menus also Downgraded the experience of eating in the restaurants as too restrictive. 
The deluxe partial sea view room was lovely- beautiful view, nice comfy huge bed, nice shower. Free water tea and coffee in room which was greatly appreciated and well restocked daily for us. The only niggle was it was 3 adults but the third bed was a fold away bed (which we knew beforehand) but would have expected an actual divan bed in the room for a 3rd adult in such a place as Dubai!

Everyone from the moment that I exited the car to when I entered another to leave was so very friendly, helpful, kind and even fun!  Dale, the concierge answered all of my questions and made some wonderful recommendations.  The beautiful young woman at the registration desk (shame on me for forgetting her name), was sweet, helpful and a joy to see on almost a daily basis.  Peter from the moment that I stepped foot onto Bloomsbury grounds to the night before I left was kind, informative, and exceeded that which I expected with regards to directions, information etc.  Tony was a joy with who to speak, lots of knowledge information and fun.  And there was an older man with glasses who was very kind as well as a younger man who made my day whenever I saw him with his big smile and greeting of ""good morning.""  This staff is not one of a 4 star hotel, but that of a 10 stars if such thing existed.  Exceptional!  The hotel itself was very nice and clean. .. not fancy like the Ritz, so if that is what you want, then don't book, but it is quaint, lovely, well decorated and clean.  The rooms are a nice size.  I love that they had a kettle and Nespresso machine, so I was able to have tea and night to warm me up a bit from the damp cold as well as coffee in the morning.  Nice selection of teas and always leaving cookies!  The housekeeping staff kept my room clean.  The bed was so comfortable with nice, white crisp clean sheets.  The only issues I had were 1: the heating/cooling system can be confusing until you learn how to use it 2. until the day that I left, I could not figure out the lighting system-- so many switches and I don
t know which worked what, except for the restroom and the little ones beside the bed 3. the outlet in the bathroom had only 2 prongs instead of 3, whereby I had to used the hairdryer in the room.  It was very quiet for the most part: I hardly heard any police sirens and only heard one neighbor talking, but she had a naturally loud voice as I learned on the elevator!   I ate breakfast only one morning, and realized that it wasn't worth the money for me as I am a tiny eater in the morning.  But they did have a nice selection and the food was very good, but I preferred to go the creperie around the corner every evening to pick up a croissant, which is plenty for me in the morning.  The bar area is upscale, beautiful and very popular... every night it was quite full, but there are seats.  Evidently, locals enjoy it as well as patrons.  But the noise did not transfer into the rooms. The location is excellent: tube is essentially one block away, theater district 15 minutes walk, Westminster Abbey, Parliament etc., 20 minutes (I am a faster walker, so 25 for some), Piccadilly 15 minutes, British museum 3-5 minute walk.  Essentially there is much to see within a short walking distance and the tube is right there.  Overall, I cannot say enough about the Bloomsbury!  I recommend this hotel to anyone who appreciates extraordinary service, comfort, cleanliness and a optimal location.

It is attention to detail like this and the warmth the staff exude which makes the hotel so exceptional.

We stayed in Albergo del Senato, for the 2nd time because personally, we belief this is the best hotel to stay in Rome.  We have never had a problem in this hotel.
My wife and I stayed 6 nights Apr. 19 - Apr 24, 2024 in a Superior double room (one of the highest floors - we could not get one with a balcony this time) with a wonderful window facing the Pantheon. The wonderful room, not too big but with a very comfortable bed, pillow and good size bathroom.  We booked it with buffet breakfast - delicious! and excellent service - you are treated as if you are the only one eating breakfast! 
The location IS the best.  Walking distance practically to every attraction.  We walked to the Coliseum and if you can walk and like to walk, you can even walk to the Vatican!  Location is incredible.
The staff is great, very helpful..  Recommended delicious restaurants including one right around the corner of the hotel we had the best pizza in the world! - assuming you like a thin crust.  Even free Limoncelo!  
Next time we visit Rome, we will definitely - without a doubt - stay in Albergo del Senato again.  
Recommendation:  
1.  We were able to get a better price booking the room using the Hotel's website.
2.  A taxi transfer from the airport (Fumicino) to the hotel is a flat rate of 50 euros if you follow the route dedicated exclusively to taxis AND cannot pay attention to anyone asking you to take you because it can become very expensive.",COUPLES,30-04-2024,Albergo del Senato,42,albergo del senato(rome)

Upon check in we were told that the city tax must be paid in cash ""6 Euros"" per person per night at checkout.  We knew about the city tax before traveling to Italy, so we were not surprised.  And in fact, the hotel in Florence that we stayed at also told us that it must be paid in cash/Euros at checkout. So upon check out we paid the 24 Euros in cash and the front desk clerk (gentleman) gave us a receipt. Of course, the receipt for the transaction was in Italian but regardless, I still had a receipt.  Upon returning home, I was doing my on-line banking and realized that the hotel had also charged my debit card $26.81 for the city tax.  I contacted the hotel and they told me that I did not pay ""Euros"" upon checking out and that I gave them my credit card to charge this to.

As a business traveler, I specifically asked the hotel staff if all charges‚Äîincluding breakfast and room service‚Äîcould be included on a single invoice for reimbursement purposes. They assured me this was possible. However, when I checked out, I discovered that these charges had already been processed separately by credit card and could not be added to the main invoice. The hotel staff claimed they didn‚Äôt have access to the restaurant charges, which was both unexpected and unacceptable. For business travelers who need comprehensive billing for expenses, this is a serious issue. While the hotel may be adequate for tourists, I would not recommend it for business stays due to their inability to consolidate charges properly.

Accustomed to hotels in the Accor group, we wanted to test the Pullman next to Mercury where we have stayed before. Arrived around 3:30 pm, the room was not yet ready, we were allowed a drink at the hotel bar to wait. 16h15 arrival in room, we discover the very nice place with the beautiful unobstructed view of the Eiffel Tower on the 10th floor. Little disappointment because I had specified by email and during the booking that it was for a specific stay to celebrate our 8 years of marriage and the receptionist at the reception had indicated us a particular attention in room and nothing was done (no upgrade, no special attention ...) pity. Regarding room 1037, noted problem of very low water pressure and no hot water on the rain effect at the top of the shower ceiling, a little average and not so acceptable for an establishment of this standing especially at the price of the hotel night!!! The bedroom has a marked look on the furniture, traces of beating and rubbing on the walls, fortunately the view was there to make up for the inconvenience.   Rooftop closed because privatized for an event of the dassault company, we would have liked to have a drink or dinner to admire the view from the hotel shame... Breakfast the next morning, perfect nothing to say beautiful buffet, hearty and qualitative. The hotel as a whole the common areas are clean, very good smell, the restaurant frame is very nice and qualitative, and the staff as a whole is very caring for guests and very helpful. 

In summary, a little disappointed with our romantic stay because I would have liked to have a privileged moment where special attention during our stay especially as I had specified by email my request.

Sleep Quality: 4",Good location bad service,"Looking forward to the Eiffel Tower view and visited. I was expecting a lot of expensive prices and the view was really good. The front staff I first met was also friendly. The quality of service problems were separate.
1. I ordered room service, but I came and delivered food without a greeting, and asked if I had to pay for the venue, so I just said so, and after the payment I looked without saying anything. The staff member who brought me breakfast was very friendly, and it seems to be a problem for the staff member. Worried about the room service? A feeling of wanting expression and ignorance.

2. In the morning, I was preparing for breakfast in my room, and the cleaning team opened without a knock. And when I realize there's a person, I immediately close. It's a luxury hotel, and it's not a neighborhood motel, it's an incomprehensible part of just opening doors without any knock. Nearby motels shouldn't do that.

Charm and challenges of an older property no different from our experiences with El Tovar main suite and Bucky ONeil Suite, Grand Canyon and Zion National Park Lodge ...i.e. location on prime National Park ""real estate"" for active and nature minded individuals.   

If it helps, expect quirky imperfections along with the privilege of enjoying national treasures.   In this visit, so thankful a quieter Classic Cottage in a duplex setting was available for our gear sorting and healthy ""eats"", cooler with lots of water and hydrating options we shopped for in Fresno.   Bathroom and side storage area buffer from unit on back side.   Room was clean, all needed features working...used the small heater (similar quirky heating workaround to our Bucky ONeil Cabin in Grand Canyon years earlier)...shower water hot...pressure, low flow conservation fixture. 

All staff were attentive, helpful and friendly during our encounters when we needed assistance.  We generally like our privacy and independence and requested no contact for housekeeping...we booked for location and ambiance vs. pampering ...extra supplies provided upon request with short explanation from us, no questions asked...tp, extra towels, coffee etc....Note:  coffee machine was not a regular Nespresso machine but thinner single serve expresso like caffeine hits.   worked for us...we left the other type we brought from Fresno for housekeeping to pass along or trash.

Classic cottage was delayed about an hour as final inspection and placement of a concierge collaborative bottle of chilled wine was placed with glasses pre arrival..  

After 16.85 mile 4 mile, Panorama to John Muir ""walk about"" with side explorations...next day...broke down and enjoyed the buffet breakfast to replace calories and experience the ""dining room""...Meal warm, views beautiful, staff thoughtful, smiling and attentive.   Iconic window seating...thank you who ever allowed the cap wearing tired old dude peaceful table location to enjoy the ""historic dining room experience"" with his better half of many years...buffet choices warm, varied and actually preferred as no waiting around.   Industrial makeshift trailers housing kitchen crews and equipment outside some windows was expected.   

Forced valet situation was never an issue we thought might hamper our ""get n go"" plans.  Guys and one gal all friendly, literally fast and always helpful with our questions they have probably answered many times before us.   Tips are shared by Valet team, Bell help is individual.   Tips never expected, service on point with our expectations...thanks to check out day Valet who turned the rental seat heat on.   Who knew the joys of heated seats on cold mornings....smile.  Really appreciated the small extra stuff given the hustle and bustle at the stand...
 
Prices:  imagine being a supplier, employee or contractor having to drive the winding roads for crazy beautiful Yosemite valley access and surroundings...yes, prices are high but not different from other similar like properties nestled in the middle of national treasures.    

So grateful the hotel and staff attempt to make the best of a tough (but needed) construction situation so future couples, families, etc....can enjoy the property for many years to come.....",COUPLES,31-10-2024,The Ahwahnee,44,ahwahnee hotel(california)

The hotel is majestic, historic, and aged just like we like it to be, and we would stay there again. However, the hotel management needs to heed the areas of improvement needed as mentioned in many of these recent reviews. 

Dining in the great room is a treat but due to the construction and shut down of the kitchen only buffet dining is available. The buffet is basically the same every night and really below average even for a buffet and at $66 per plate, overpriced as well. Service and seating are limited because of ‚Äúshort staffing‚Äù but it‚Äôs a buffet? Why not do a BBQ or bring in gourmet food trucks as alternatives. Why is the bar on short hours and no small bites available there? 

Every cottage we were in had the split system AC inoperative and replaced with floor portable AC that don‚Äôt have sufficient capacity, and heat in the cottage was a small electric heater thus we were hot then cold. Wi-Fi in cottages does not work well at all. Room was not serviced as the staff was ‚Äúreally busy‚Äù. You get exactly one towel and one coffee pellet per person if your room is serviced at all.

I have stayed in many hotels and I realize cleaning and turning over a hotel room is hard work. However, usually management ensures the rooms are inspected before they are given to the next guest. I do not know what management is thinking but our room was dirty, dusty, and had a pathetic wisp of a blanket cover. Accountability is on management, maybe there is not enough help or staff are not effectively trained. Gosh, even the carpet was horrible with visible stains. The bathroom tub did not drain, and the air permeated with camp-fire smoke either due to someone building a fire right outside or just poor ventilation. I was surprised the smoke alarms did not go off. The treat was for a high-priced room located in the magical valley of Yosemite. The Yosemite Valley was magical but the Ahwahnee was not the hotel experience I had hoped for. I would not mind the construction, the subpar food, or the smoke however any room, small or large, budget or premium, the BASIC expectation is a clean room.",FAMILY,31-10-2024,The Ahwahnee,44,ahwahnee hotel(california) 
Brisbane,1,,Sever Security Breach.,"Severely disappointing experience. My husband and I stayed for 2 nights at the Ahwahnee Hotel. Prior to arriving we had read the poor reviews online and were prepared the hotel wasn‚Äôt going to be in its highest state of glory. However, the most disappointing part was the service. 
Firstly, we arrived after a long day of driving at 4:30pm to find our room still wasn‚Äôt available- despite check in being at 4pm. The hotel couldn‚Äôt give any estimate on when it would be ready either and didn‚Äôt seem remotely sorry just said to come back later. Even some sort of apology would have gone a long way as this was our first impression of the hotel. 
On finally making it to our room, the reviews are indeed correct about the state of the rooms- but again we were at least prepared for this. 
The really issue came on our second day at the hotel where we left early on a full day hike at 7am and returned at 5:30pm. On returning to our cabin/ cottage we found not just one but BOTH doors to our cabin to be completely wide open. Anyone that accesses the property would have been able to see our doors completely open and have full access to our room!! Including access to wallets with credit cards and money, jewellery and passports!!! Given the notoriety of the hotel and that we were the first cabin located off from the main hotel building we were very concerned by the extreme breach of safety and security!! 
We immediately went to the main desk to explain our severe dissatisfaction and the manager we spoke to could not have been more rude. She offered absolutely no apology for the situation at all just simply said it was the house keepers first day and that‚Äôs all. While we were extremely mad at what had happened some compassion and sympathy would have gone a really long way. After again explaining our disappointment at the extremely overpriced amount of money one pays to stay this hotel to not even be able to provide basics like locking a door while providing a room service was an awfully upsetting end to what was a great day of hiking for us. The manager eventually offered to compensate us with a 20% discount of the room rate for ONE NIGHT ONLY which again did little to make up for the experience. 
Overall, while what happened was extremely concerning and we were lucky that again none of our belongings were stolen what was the most disappointing was the lack of care or compassion from management about our situation. We again saw the manager on check out and she again offered no apology to us. After checkout again I sent a follow up email to express my disappointment and have not received any communication from the hotel- so it‚Äôs clear that the hotel simply does not care for any feedback whatsoever. If you wish to have all of your personal belongings accessible to be stolen from entire public walking through the hotel and have no compassion from the staff or care whatsoever then please stay at this hotel. But we will never return. It unfortunately ruined our time in Yosemite and we left with very un fond memories.",COUPLES,31-10-2024,The Ahwahnee,44,ahwahnee hotel(california) 
,1,,A Sad Sight,"We went in to the hotel to see if they had a gift shop since the park store was underwhelming. In full transparency, the gift shop was the was the only impressive aspect of this once beautiful hotel aside from its excellent location. 

The gift shop had a great selection of high quality, embroiled apparel and local artisan pieces of artwork/pottery on display. An excellent selection of merchandise and friendly staff (in there only).

In walking around the common areas of the hotel lobby I first was in awe of the grand scale and craftsmanship of the main great room. There was a musty, stuffy smell throughout the hotel that felt as if there was zero ventilation occurring. The closer I started to look around the sadder I got seeing the peeling paint on the water damaged ceiling, filthy worn out furniture, finishes worn off of every surface, this is a very neglected sad state of affairs. 

The water station was empty and looked dilapidated. People were in a line at a reservation both to make an in person reservation? Very outdated way to book a reservation. A man got out of an elevator and had to open a cage door, something I haven't seen in years nor is it safe by today's standards. 

I went online to check out the prices thinking this is probably a $300 a night property (being a bit high just for the location) but my jaw nearly dropped when I saw the $900 a night rate. Absolute highway robbery. Fortunately we were staying at Rush Creek Lodge for half the price and 10x the amenities in a much cleaner, better serviced hotel a short drive from the park.  

Hopefully this once beautiful hotel gets the attention it needs to bring it back to its glory. The place has insane potential to be an absolutely exceptional property. Current management seems to be lettering the place deteriorate by deferring the extensive, long overdue basic maintenance for now in addition to cost cutting wherever possible. Unfortunately it is glaring to even passing through guests so I can't imagine what it must be like to stay here.",FAMILY,31-10-2024,The Ahwahnee,44,ahwahnee hotel(california)

Sleep Quality: 4","So so Lodging and Dining, Unique Ambiance","We go to The Ahwahnee every 10 years for our wedding anniversary.  This was our fourth visit so I'll cut to the chase.  The only practical reason to go to The Ahwahnee is to bask in the ambiance of the public spaces -  the Great Lounge and its side rooms, the dining room, and the grounds between the hotel and the river.  Hold that thought.

On this visit, our first $700 ""Classic View"" room overlooked the exhaust fans on the kitchen roof and a bunch of construction trailers.  After repeated pleas and griping to the front desk and the manager, we were transferred to a larger room with a filtered valley view which was satisfactory.  The rooms have a classic decor but are not fancy.

Aramark had warned us repeatedly about the ongoing construction and its impact on meal service so we had only one meal in the dining room.  This was a $30 per person  buffet breakfast with a decent array of food choices but many of the hot items were not, in fact, hot.  Service was excellent, attentive but not overbearing.  I think the servers were glad to see somebody, anybody, in the restaurant.  It was far from crowded even with the the relaxation of the dress code which meant baseball caps (not removed)  and flip flops were acceptable fashion.

We had drinks in the bar but no ""light bites"" were available as described in the list of hotel amenities because of some problem inspectors had found in the kitchen.

There were private, noisy events in the Under Lounge and Solarium both nights we were there so there was no relaxing in the Great Lounge experience. 

Why stay there if visitors can enjoy the public spaces and dining experience?  Because only by STAYING there can you feel like you BELONG there.  That's the heart of The Ahwanhee's value proposition.",COUPLES,30-09-2024,The Ahwahnee,44,ahwahnee hotel(california)

Yes, it is noisy, yes, you can hear yelling from the bar downstairs and occasional music,-- but it's nothing awful. If you are a light sleeper-don't book it. If you live in a city or anywhere with some traffic noise at night, you will be fine. You can also request a room that is NOT over the bar, and those rooms are quiet. This hotel is not at all ADA accessible, there are no elevators. It is smack dab in the heart of downtown, with Rainbow Foods (grocery store) in walking distance, Foggy Mountain (shop for outdoor gear) in walking distance, and two famous and cheap restaurants, as well as a post office--less than 30 seconds from the front door. Deckhand Dave's Fish Tacos and the Alaskan Crepe Escape are some of the best and cheapest food in town, and they are right by it. I felt safer in this location as a young solo woman than I would've on the outskirts of town--yes there are homeless and yes there are drunks, but it is also bustling with tourists 24/7. It is warm, clean, fresh sheets, clean bathrooms. I had some of my best sleep ever in this hotel! Checking in is a bit of a pain, you have to be very assertive and get the bartender's attention--they don't staff the hotel so the bartender must walk over and check you in.

It‚Äôs right next to the Tower Hill Tube station, which has lifts (nice when you have luggage). The lobby is cool.

The rooms are compact, but functional with a thoughtful storage compartment under the bed. The standout features are a large, comfortable bed, plush bath sheets and amazing views. Our room overlooked the Tower or London and Tower Bridge. Some rooms have a view of The Shard. We were glad the room had a free Wi-Fi, a mini fridge and a safe. One negative: no washcloths to use the body wash provided. If you want fresh towels daily, you need to request that via the in-room iPad.

When other hotels kind of are the same CitizenM hits differently. It has a certain hip feeling without going too overboard going pretentious. I'm usually very skeptical with things like quotes on walls, little jokes here and there but they pull it off in a clever way and it suits my persona.

We were originally on the 2nd floor and this corner suite has more living space, and the bathroom has a double sink, shower over bath and a separate room for the toilet
We were moved after the first night to the 6th floor and this corner suite has slightly less living space due to the layout, and only one sink in the bathroom but a separate bath and shower, with toiletries
(info may be helpful depending on your needs as the rooms were different in layout and amenities)
We had an issue with the bed in the first room, this was kindly resolved by the manager Fabian by moving us to the 6th floor (as the technician was unable to fix it and to also allow them time to replace the bed in the 2nd floor room for other guests)
We have stayed at this hotel several times and never had any concerns, the bed was broken on this occasion but the staff would have been unaware of this issue unless they happened to be sleeping in the bed!
Fabian was very kind and courteous, and the issue resolved satisfactorily and promptly
The rooms were clean, and well furnished and the breakfast selection more than ample
We ate in the restaurant in the lobby on one occasion and the meal was good, with pleasant staff throughout the hotel

Noida,3,,A Disappointing 5-Star Experience at Hyatt Amritsar,"I chose Hyatt Amritsar after a frustrating experience at Courtyard Marriott, despite being a Platinum Marriott member. The Courtyard Marriott staff was unhelpful and unwilling to accommodate even minor requests. 

Having stayed at luxury hotels like ITC and Taj in India, I've come to expect a certain standard of hospitality. However, my experience at Hyatt Amritsar was a stark reminder that not all 5-star hotels live up to this standard.

Positive Aspects:

* The reservation staff was helpful and courteous.
* The staff at the front gate was polite and always willing to help.

Negative Aspects:

* Check-in: We were kept waiting for over 20 minutes for our room keys, and the staff seemed disorganized and uncoordinated.
* In-room Dining: The staff's tone was unprofessional and bordering on rude during our in-room dining requests.
* Checkout: The front desk staff's insistence on retrieving all room keys, even though they are just inexpensive plastic, was unnecessary and time-consuming. His statement that ""we can't check out until we have all the keys"" was, first of all, incorrect, but also the way he said it made it look like we were trying to steal them, ha! I have stayed 100s of nights in 5 star properties worldwide but this was one of the most insane things I have heard.
* Discriminatory Treatment: The staff's behavior towards foreign guests, particularly white European travelers, was noticeably different. They were less respectful towards Indian guests.
* Valet Attitude: The valet's comment about a short trip being unnecessary was odd and unprofessional. Perhaps they are underpaid or dissatisfied with their jobs.

Overall Impression:

While the staff at the entrance was polite and welcoming, the overall experience at Hyatt Amritsar was disappointing. The lack of coordination, unprofessional behavior, and discriminatory treatment were unacceptable. I would strongly recommend considering other options, such as Taj, for a truly luxurious and memorable experience. 

Hyatt Amritsar's management needs to pay closer attention to these details to ensure a truly 5-star experience.

I had to provide the hotel with the alternative solution of offering my card details but under no circumstances to be charged - I shouldn't be the one offering solutions and your staff should be more welcoming, not arguing and having an attitude. There was no apology and no proper explanation. Communication should be key on the front desk and specifically from ""manager on duty"" as the girl said.

While I appreciated the upgrade to a suite, which was indeed lovely, I encountered several issues that detracted from my overall experience.

The main areas of the hotel, which I was looking forward to enjoying, were unfortunately closed throughout most of my stay. The Sunset Terrace was closed all day on both Monday and Tuesday, and although it finally opened on Wednesday, it was only after I had already left the hotel. Similarly, the Rooftop Panorama was closed every day, and on Tuesday night, when it was finally available, it was booked for a private cocktail reception, further restricting access.

Additionally, I had hoped to enjoy a beach or pool experience, but the hotel did not offer either during my stay, which was quite disappointing.

On a positive note, I would like to express my gratitude to the breakfast team. Fatlya, Clara Cruz, and Chef Kevin Samya were outstanding in accommodating my kosher requirements, and their service truly stood out as a highlight of my stay.

I hope you can take my feedback into consideration to improve the experience for future guests.

Thank you for your time and attention.",COUPLES,30-09-2024,JW Marriott Cannes,52,jw cannes (france )

We booked the night before our arrival so we could get in the room when we landed in the morning and this worked out well.   We called a few times to make sure there was no confusion and our room was indeed available at 10 am.  The bed was comfortable.  The restaurant and bar in the hotel were expensive but it was a very good buffet breakfast and good coffee.   For parking, I made the mistake of parking myself in the garage.  It was easy to get in and find a spot, but getting out of the garage was an adventure.  I would recommend using the valet service.    Once you park, you won't need the car, as you can walk to the beach, all of the shopping, and a ton of good restaurants and hotel bars.  

The only negatives for this hotel:
1) The gym is terrible.  There are no free weight dumbbells.  There was one curl bar with a few small weight plates and a universal machine that had some disconnected cables.  There was only one elliptical and it was broken.  Really disappointing for a nice and expensive hotel. 
2) There is no designated beach area/restaurant on the beach associated with the hotel.  If you are not planning on going to the beach, then it's no big deal.  But if you are, it's easy with the hotels that have a designated area.",COUPLES,30-09-2024,JW Marriott Cannes,52,jw cannes (france )

Zurich,1,,PLEASE DONT GO THERE!,"I am currently staying at the JW Marriott Hotel Cannes, and I must say, this experience has been nothing short of terrible. I strongly advise against choosing this hotel. Here are just a few reasons why:

	‚Ä¢	Terrible Customer Service: The staff shows no empathy or courtesy. They are unresponsive and lack the basic hospitality you‚Äôd expect from a hotel of this supposed standard.
	‚Ä¢	Outdated and Dirty Rooms: The rooms are old, poorly maintained, and simply dirty. It‚Äôs disappointing to see a lack of attention to cleanliness in a hotel of this category.
	‚Ä¢	Under Construction: There‚Äôs a part of the hotel under construction right in front, making the environment unpleasant and noisy, which ruins the experience even more.
	‚Ä¢	No Value for Money: For the price you pay, the quality and service are far below expectations. This is absolutely not worth it.

Our stay at the Armani Hotel in Dubai was nothing short of magical, but what truly made it stand out was the incredible kindness and compassion we received from one remarkable individual‚ÄîRami. He wasn‚Äôt just a staff member; he became a beacon of support and care for my family during a time we needed it the most.

While we were staying at the hotel, we unexpectedly fell ill. Rami‚Äôs immediate and heartfelt response to our situation was beyond anything we could have imagined. He didn‚Äôt just help us with routine hospitality‚Äîhe treated us like family, perhaps even better than family. From the moment he realized we were unwell, he made it his personal mission to ensure our comfort and recovery.

Rami arranged a late check-out so we could rest as long as we needed, gave us breakfast to ensure we had nourishment, and kept checking in on us as if we were his own. When we needed medical help, Rami swiftly arranged for a doctor to visit our room. Not only that, but he personally saw to it that our prescriptions were delivered directly to us from the pharmacy. His attention to detail, care, and genuine concern turned what could have been a stressful time into one of comfort and reassurance.

Rami‚Äôs kindness went far beyond professionalism. He was warm, attentive, and truly empathetic‚Äîqualities that are hard to come by. His presence alone made us feel safe and cared for, and he left an indelible mark on our hearts. It‚Äôs not often that you meet someone in hospitality who feels like a lifelong friend, but Rami is exactly that kind of person.

While the Armani Hotel is a stunning testament to luxury and elegance, it‚Äôs the people, especially Rami, who make it a home away from home. He didn‚Äôt just meet expectations; he exceeded them in ways we couldn‚Äôt have imagined. If there‚Äôs one thing we will always remember from our time in Dubai, it‚Äôs the generosity and kindness of Rami.

We will forever be grateful for his compassion during our stay and will return to the Armani Hotel not just for its beauty, but for the wonderful people like him who make it truly exceptional.

I‚Äôve traveled all over the world, have never experienced this type of hospitality. God bless Rami and the Armani hotel! 100 out of 10 stars !",FAMILY,31-10-2024,Armani Hotel,57,armani hotel (uae)

But that weary was soon dissolved by Mumbai FS chefs, as they cooked us different Indian dishes and Mumbai street foods. I feel I didn't miss out on anything and the plus is I enjoyed the food and did not get ill with the food. Despite being busy the Executive Chef made time to come and talk to us, its like they all telepathic knew that the way to my heart is through food:-) 

I had particularly gone to Mumbai FS to celebrate my birthday. Oh boy, the celebrations were beyond my wildest dreams! Just what I wanted and far above.

Although the hotel is undergoing some renovations, disruptions were minimised and solutions were found for the unavoidable, e.g the swimming pool is not functioning at the moment, so they linked up with another hotel for FS guests to go there and use the swimming pool. I had that experience as well, of going to the other hotel for swimming and I enjoyed it, because a car was provided to take me to and from, the staff from the other hotel were as pleasant as well.

I can't brag enough about FS Mumbai, but its worth the experience. I would recommend for people visiting Mumbai to taste this remarkable hotel, to see and feel this exquisite experience. Thank you FS Mumbai staff.",FRIENDS,31-10-2024,Four Seasons Hotel Mumbai,60,four seasons  (india )
,5,,An exceptional stay at an exceptional hotel,"I love this hotel. It's home away from home for me.  The staff, location, rooms, and service are exceptional.

Mayank Yadav  and Fagun Singh, are exceptional.
They pay attention to every time detail.

Abhishek, their chef,  Alankar in their restaurant were all excellent.

No matter how busy they were, we  felt like we were the only ones there.

The fitness center, facility and staff are always accommodating and helpful.

The car services to and from the airport and while in the city were all just impeccable.
The airline lost my bags and the hotel went above and beyond to help me.

Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum),5,,A fantastic hotel in the middle of Mumbai,"Dear Mr Gandhi,

Please find below some feedback regarding my stay at the FS Mumbai from Sep 25-30, 2024. I am sorry this is a little late: I have been traveling. I have already filled out your online survey; here I wish to provide some further feedback.

I am a regular guest of your hotel since it first opened in 2008, and I normally stay in your hotel whenever I visit Mumbai.

The following staff provided outstanding service:

Kitchen - Chef Abhishek Gurav and Chef Kathiravan prepared customised orders for me every day during my five-night stay. The food was always fresh and delicious and according to my dietary preferences. Chef Jude Fernando and his team are doing a fantastic job. I found the breakfast buffet to be wonderful, food items were innovatively presented and there were every day some unexpected items on the buffet, such as the Gujarati specialties. You have a great kitchen team!

F&B Service - Alankar Mantri took great care of me during every meal at the 2nd floor restaurant. Amey Kudtarkar provided exceptional service every day.

IRD - Chetan and his team are doing an outstanding job of running IRD. Orders are always delivered on time, and they pay great attention to detail. They anticipate guest needs and often deliver delightful surprises. Sarvesh, Nayan, Gajanan, Pritesh, Harshal and Sudeshna all provided wonderful service.

Concierge - Fagun, Driver Rajesh Shetye

HK - Sabah and his team are doing a fantastic job of ensuring that my room is set up according to my preferences even before I check in, which saves time once I checkin. Vrushabh, Maaz, Gopikrishna did everything to make my stay memorable.

Aer Bar - Pranav, Vineeth Krishna, Eshwar, Kim, Adnan (service) and Adnan (bartender) provided great service.

Modernist - I had one meal and a drink at the Modernist, and it was a great experience. Chef Abhit made some very nice food for me, and Swayam and Sauraj took great care of me.

Engg. - Laxman, Mayuresh

Other feedabck and areas to improve:

1. I did face a problem two times with IRD orders. I ordered north Indian food with less oil and asked them not to put red chilly powder, but unfortunately the order was floating with oil and rich masalas. I was hungry and did not have time to reurn the order, so I ate it, which led me to have an upset stomach and affected my work for the day. I suggest your chefs be trained in how to prepare home-style food with less oil and no masala. Contrary to popular belief, Punjabi food is not about heavy gravies and intense spices. It's more about clean flavours and cooked in mustard oil with minimal spices. I have suggested to Chef Fernando that perhaps your chefs should have a session with Mumbai-based Punjabi Chef Sherry Mehta to learn about how to create home-style Punjabi food.

2. At Opus, I found the staff to be unresponsive to customer needs. I had sat down for a meeting and ordered a juice. The area under the table was very dirty with a sticky syrupy substance. I noticed my shoes had got stuck to the floor. I asked the restaurant staff for help three times, but no one helped me. I got the impression that there is no one in charge of that restaurant and that things are running pn autopilot--not a good situation! After this experience, I did not go back to Opus dirung the rest of my stay.

3. The newly-renovated Aer bar is very nice. The music the DJs play is good, but there are several tracks where the quality of the sound is not good, and it almost sounds like noise. Maybe some better tracks can be played.

4. This time at the spa, my expereince at the steam bath was not good. The steam was coming from the top, which made my head get overwhelmed with heat and I quickly exited the steam room. I feel that the steam should come form below the bench. Also, there was no way for the guest to control the temperature of the steam room.

5. I attended an IGCC conference meeting in your banquets and was shocked to see that you all are still using plastic water bottles. Request you to switch to glass bottles completely.

6. The toilet in my room, even after flushing, would keep running everyday, wasting a lot of water. Every day I would call Engineering and everyday they would fix it, but after some time it would start running again. Request you to have the problem fixed as it is a colossal waste of water.

It was overall a good experience to stay at your hotel again, and I am looking forward to my next trip.

Sincerely,

Ashish Mohan",BUSINESS,30-09-2024,Four Seasons Hotel Mumbai,60,four seasons  (india )

I asked if this was ok, to which he just glared. 
Other groups of aisan tourists arrived taking photos and he did not bother them or storm up asking what they were doing. 
Some welcome. 
I would never stay here again purely as this man is so rude and obviously does not even like people being in what he sees as his hotel. 
It‚Äôs the guests who pay the wages, so perhaps treat us a little more politely, or dare I say, just like a decent human being. 
We went on to stay at a far more superior and expensive hotel, where the welcome was gorgeous and everyone was made to feel welcome and at ease.

On day one, I was waiting on a room / was exploring and the bellhop left the luggage in the room, but left cards on my luggage and my backpack and just triggered some tip fatigue in me. One card would be fine. 

The property is a true expansive resort on the water. 20 minutes from downtown. About 40$ taxi from the airport, a bit less with a ride share.

The maid service was very good but the rest of the front desk or restaurants were inattentive and not interested in offering their services.  I was treated as if I didn‚Äôt exist. No extra effort was offered during my stay. It was unbelievable. For example I ordered my lunch and the waitress said she was going on her 30 minute break but the food will be out shortly.  It wasn‚Äôt.   At my dinners I would have like liked another drink but there was no help to make that happen.  I wanted to order another sushi roll but I had to wait. The restaurant wasn‚Äôt that busy at all. I called the hotel prior to stay to get a 2pm checkout as a Bonvoy member.  When I reminded the front desk of the arrangement he questioned me like I was a liar.  He asked who did I spoke with and when did I call, etc.  I asked for a 1:30pm checkout and he told me his compromise was 12:30.  I checked out at 12 noon but I was really disappointed with his response and approach. I was told that this hotel is an upscale hotel and they are not offered often.

The staff could not have been nicer. We had a suite near the pools with a partial view of the Ocean and it was outstanding! Getting around was easy , we took some shuttles uphill but mostly enjoyed the exercise.
We stayed on site the entire stay with the exception of a round of golf at Sandpiper next door. Once the hotel knew we were playing they arranged for complimentary transportation from our room in a golf cart, to a Ritz Suburban and a five minute drive over to the golf course. Incredible! They repeated the favor when we were done. 
We did the vigorous nature trail on a warm day, walked the beach and toured the property. We spent half a day at the pool closest to the ocean and did some laps in the pool, very nice and amazing staff around the pool.
We ate all of our meals at the hotel. The first night we ate at Angel and Oak, I left a separate review for that but it was impressive and the staff was great!! We ate both mornings outside at The Bistro and that was a great way to start the day, had one lunch at the pool and Makayla made it a perfect pool day.

Alhambra,1,,Poor communication and customer service,"This review is strictly based on my recent experience with their customer relations and food/beverage team. 

I originally called and spoke with Carla in Room Service on Sat 8/24 to send a special birthday treat to a friend who is checking in the next day to celebrate her birthday. I was having issues completing the e-form they sent via email, since I didn't have the confirmation number. Next day, day of birthday/arrival, I called again and spoke with Daniel. He resent the expired email link and gave me the confirmation number to fill out the e-form. On the form, I specifically indicated that I wanted a bottle of Prosecco, peach nectar (to make bellinis) and chocolate dipped strawberries. I also got the email address to their Guest Relations, Avelino, for them to type up a birthday message. I received an email from both Daniel and Avelino, assuring me that it will be delivered after they arrive. Avelino even said he just typed up the card and finished blowing up her balloons.

It's almost 11pm and I still have not heard from my friend about her birthday goodies. I texted her asking if she enjoyed them and to my surprise, she had no idea what I was referring to. She didn't receive anything. 

Monday morning, I called Avelino to ask him what happened? He said that my friend left a DND sign and they failed to leave a note under the door, but just left a voicemail. And we all know that no one really looks at the hotel phone! He assured me that everything will be delivered and apologized for the mishap. I reminded him again of what I ordered: a bottle of Prosecco, peach nectar (to make bellinis) and chocolate dipped strawberries.

Monday @2pm, my friend sent a photo of the goodies and NO PEACH NECTAR. And to top it off, the card message was from GUEST RELATIONS! It was supposed to be my personal message! So now it just made it seem like it was from Ritz, not me!

Cork,3,,Disappointing,"We had three Deluxe rooms booked for two nights on arrival in India and then returning for one night at the end of our trip. 

It is a very busy hotel, well located if you want to walk to Connaught Place. Nice pool but no poolside service. Rooms clean and adequate but would not describe it as 5-star or luxury. Attitudes of reception staff vary - a couple very helpful and friendly.  Slow check-in and check-out.

We arrived before 10:00am after a couple of long-flights. Check-in time at the hotel was stated as 14:00 but both the guide who dropped us at the hotel and one of the hotel staff where hopeful that rooms would be cleaned and available by 12:00 noon. We waited until 12:00 and during this time asked twice if we could have access to Wifi but were told that was not possible until a room had been allocated. At noon I approached the desk again, with half our party asleep in the lobby. I was reminded of the 14:00 check-in time and told that no Deluxe rooms would be ready until at least that time. However, we could have Executive rooms available immediately. In a moment of sleep-deprived weakness I agreed to being ‚Äòupsold‚Äô these rooms. This cost us 26,880 INR (about 300 EUR) for 3 rooms for 2 nights (in effect for the 2 hours from 12:00 to 14:00 - if they were going to ‚Äòupsell‚Äô at least they could have done it at 10:00 and we could have benefited from 4 hours!). 

I think the ‚ÄòExecutive‚Äô rooms and the ‚ÄòDeluxe‚Äô rooms are pretty much the same (we had a Deluxe room when we returned at the end of the tour and it appeared to have the same facilities albeit a slightly different layout). The benefit the ‚ÄòExecutive‚Äô rooms appear to have is access to a lounge on the top floor for buffet food and cocktails for a few hours in the late afternoon and early evening. I didn‚Äôt understand what the receptionist said about the access to the lounge when she upsold the rooms so we missed out on visiting it the first night. By the second night I had worked out that the lounge was available so we set off for complimentary cocktails on 28th floor. Although billed as a ‚ÄòCocktail lounge‚Äô when we got there the server said that actually they didn‚Äôt do cocktails. There was only a small selection of spirits available (one variety of whiskey, one variety of vodka etc.) We could not eat the buffet food available as we are vegan and there didn‚Äôt appear to be anything without dairy etc. 

On our first morning we received a strange letter under the door which stated that they enclosed our room bills and would we settle it at our earliest convenience. No bill was enclosed with the letter. When we went to reception to query this we had a surreal conversation which was basically us querying the letter and the receptionist stating that there was a meeting arranged with our travel group that we should attend (??). We asked why we needed to attend this meeting, she said that she didn‚Äôt know and that we would have to attend to find out‚Ä¶.(it turned out it was a completely different travel group and nothing to do with us!).

The reason we choose this hotel in particular was that it has a vegan restaurant and we thought it would be good to be able to go to the restaurant in the hotel and know everything was vegan without having to explain what we do and do not eat etc. It turns out that the ‚ÄòVegan haven‚Äô isn‚Äôt open in the evenings. It is called ‚ÄòLe Petit Caf√©‚Äô  and appears to be having a bit of an identity crisis  in that when you approach the restaurant the first thing you see is a cabinet of lovely looking cakes - but none of these are vegan. They do have a short menu consisting of salads, wraps and a burger and some ‚Äòmini-bites‚Äô such as crispy cannelloni and bruschetta. We had the burger and all agreed it was the worst meal that we had while we were in India. An idea to improve the vegan offering is that it would be great if they could have a menu of vegan Indian street food - so you would know it was vegan and safe to eat‚Ä¶..(we won‚Äôt charge for that idea!).

At breakfast they had an extensive buffet, the vast majority of which was labelled as having milk in it. Once we asked the manger how we could find vegan food, the chef came out and was very helpful making dosas and idli and other vegetable preparations. We managed to get decaffeinated coffee on our first morning but by the second morning we were told that they had run out of decaffeinated coffee (they used instant sachets). 

The highlight of our visit to the Lalit was the Baluchi restaurant. The serving staff, the chef and the sommelier were all very helpful and knowledgeable about vegan food and wine and we had excellent food and drink there in a great restaurant.

On our return to the hotel for one night at the end of the tour, again the check-in was slow. There was a Halloween party that night and they appeared keen to sell us tickets at the desk (and then I think my son got at least two calls to his room). Focus seemed to be on ‚Äòupselling‚Äô again rather than customer care.

When we checked-out of the hotel to go to the airport we left before 07:00 and didn‚Äôt have breakfast - others had been offered a package of food to take with them but they didn‚Äôt appear to be able to do that with vegan options. 

I don‚Äôt know if the hotel offers an option to pay for early check-in (we didn‚Äôt book the hotel directly it was done through a travel agent) but it would be good if they offered that option. What would be even better would be if you could ‚Äòtrade‚Äô an early check-out when you leave for early check-in when you arrive ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ but I guess that would never happen as it would be in the customer‚Äôs interests and not the hotel‚Äôs!!",FAMILY,31-10-2024,The Lalit New Delhi,71,the lalit (new delhi)

He kindly walked me through the crowds to The Gateway of India and took photos for me. While walking, he stopped traffic and always made sure I was okay and had my phone put away and my purse zipped. I made several stops and he was always waiting patiently for me on the outside of shops, the spa and even my tattoo appointment! (Yes, this was a day out!). Bhanu drove safely, he knew when to chat and when I just wanted to relax and look out the window.

The cleanliness unfortunately leaves much to be desired. The cobwebs were not removed despite a hint. We did it ourselves. That would still be acceptable. What is not ok, however, is that the restaurants supposedly only have seats available at 10:00 p.m. Unfortunately, this is not so appropriate with a 6-year-old child. At our request, this was justified by capacity problems. 

After another request there was suddenly a seat at 19:00, Only in the restaurant nobody knew about it. But since it was relatively empty, we could of course eat at 19:00. On Feb. Tag unfortunately the same topic. It was only on 2x indication of a 6-year-old that we got a table at 19:00. Unfortunately, nobody knew about the reservation in the restaurant this time.

On our complaint we then got 5 green fees for free (allegedly). Because nobody knew about it on the golf course (so I paid for it. 

When I was just about to complain to the reception, I left after 15 minutes, as unfortunately no person responsible came. It's too bad. 

So 2 stars,w eil. The facility is really nice. But actually, I want to recover and not get angry.

London,5,,"Superb hotel. Five star staff, food and setting.","Some of the reviews had made us apprehensive about our choice of staying here. We had booked six days here and four at Maradiva and wondering if we‚Äôd made a mistake and should have booked the whole stay at the Maradiva. We hadn‚Äôt! This hotel is absolutely superb! ( Maradiva was a disappointment - see separate review)

On arrival at 8 am we were immediately shown to a room. An upgrade from what we had booked. However our beach access room wasn‚Äôt yet available. We were offered the choice of staying in the ocean view or moving later on in the day to our original view. We opted to stay in the ocean view as it was more private albeit with no beach access. 

The Rooms 
The rooms are in need of slight updating but are luxurious and spacious. Clean and beautiful linen. 

The Hotel
The grounds of this hotel are absolutely beautiful. We walked everywhere and it‚Äôs all easily accessible. No need for golf carts. The flowers and trees are so well looked after. 

The beach
We took the speedboat each day to Ile aux cerfs. We loved this option. The beach is looked after by hotel staff and private. Rambo is at the bar and an absolute star. 

Swimming Pool
Beautiful swimming pool in an amazing setting. 

Spa 
We booked several treatments which were all wonderful. 

Gift shop
Lovely little gift shop where we bought several gifts before we left for family. All reasonably priced. 

Food 

Breakfast was busy but there was a huge selection and we were well looked after.  

Dinner - we were half board but used the credit with ease and simply added the cost onto what was on the menu. Special mention to the staff at the Upper Cut. We loved every meal we had. Five star food and five star staff. Only meal which didn‚Äôt work for us was on the beach bbq at Lazy Fish. 

If you are wondering if this is or isn‚Äôt the hotel for you, ignore the poor reviews. This is truly a wonderful hotel and we may well return. The staff are all kind caring attentive and also fun!

We loved every day with you. Five stars all round.",COUPLES,30-09-2024,Four Seasons Resort Mauritius at Anahita,73,four seasons (mauritius)

The room we had was right on the beach with the perfect morning view but with tress on both sides giving you a privacy and intimate feel. It has everything comfort required, with excellent room service for the lazier days. 

Every meal was brilliant, but our favourite was Lazy fish which is right on the beach and prepared on a bbq. The fish was just superb! 

The whole team were phenomenal. Considering its a fairly big hotel, it had small hotel feel with everyone wishing you good morning, most remembering your name and always wanting to go the extra mile to ensure we had an excellent stay. What ever they are doing there, clearly works as its hands down the best hotel team we have ever experienced. 

Ensure you head to the spa. We had several treatments whilst there and was blown away every time at how amazing not only the staff were but the quality of the massages. The best we've had. A big thank you to our therapists Kavida and Charlotte who were both exceptional. 

If you fancy getting active head to the gym and do a lesson with Selvin who again, was a superb coach. He is excellent at analysing and pin pointing ways to improve your skill and take you to the next level.

We celebrated our silver wedding - everyone knew and spoiled us that day (even with a sunken bathtub with rose petals and extra long massages). The only downside is the location far away from everything touristic (no restaurants and nice boutiques within 45 minutes) and the roads are very adventurous and dangerous to drive by car. September is not the perfect time to visit because it is then winter and it rained briefly almost every day and was windy and cloudy.

Plus:
Very comfortable bedding 
Nice room at good temperature 
Very nice pool area 
Generally very friendly staff 
Excellent breakfast 

Less: 
No explanation at Check in on the facilities 
Request for twin beds before arrival and confirmed at Check in, and double bed on arrival in the room 
Most unpleasant: the security guard who asks us for our magnetic cards while we are in the lounge chairs! I specify that we are 6 people sitting in the hall and he asked us only! Really very embarrassing üòê 
Placement at breakfast: well at the bottom of the pergola, when we wished to be in the room. We were told that there was no more room, despite empty tables (Maybe reserved for an elite?) So we found ourselves next to safety barriers and a tarpaulin masking work, with the sound of drills and others .. For a hotel of this standing, it is average... 

I thought about the security guard and the double bed to the lovely young lady present at the check out, very professional and pleasant. 

In short, a bit of the impression that not everyone is housed at the same sign .. It‚Äôs a shame.. And a little disappointing.

the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful yet very professional and well trained . 
special thanks to Ms Afun Devi from the reception who actually took the time to write a personal birthday note to my wife which was a very nice touch !!

Room service was spot on and never delayed and not to mention the birthday pancake that was also provided to us during breakfast .

the final parting goodwill gesture was by Mr Asad from reception who gave us a late checkout till 4 pm .

we had a wonderful time at the hotel and highly recommend it to any one looking for a  relaxing break and especially those wishing to celebrate any special occasion as you will be pleasantly surprised

We go to the sea and for the sea , there are seaweeds on the shore , they are not taken from the sea by day (Well after the sea on Sadiyatt hardly anywhere else can like the sea , but we knew where we were going and generally tell you before new meetings beautiful Mandarin, you really VIP",COUPLES,31-05-2024,"Mandarin Oriental Jumeira, Dubai",77,mandarin oriental (uae)

India,1,,Bad Service.,"Used to be one of the best hotels to stay in Mumbai. But recent experiences have been horrible. Took two rooms from 18/10/2024 to 20/10/2024. 
Went for dinner at JW Cafe at 8pm. Food was good but terrible service. Had to literally clear the table ourselves since no one was responding. Messed up the orders. Beers were lukewarm. After even complaint they did not pay heed to our complaints. Next day the F&B manager did approach and offered a free dinner but I told him freebies is not what I‚Äôm looking for just want to keep coming back and have good experiences here as I love the hotel. Had to ultimately leave mid course after paying the bill. It‚Äôs was horrible. 

Checked out at 10:30 and forgot my used clothes in the room. Was in the hotel till 4pm having brunch and just lounging but during the whole time no one from the hotel calls up informing us that you have forgotten something in the hotel. On reaching back home I realise o forgot stuff at the hotel and contact them.Ms Marcella assures she will help but does not call. Again on calling them the housekeeper tells me that it‚Äôs company policy to not inform the guest about stuff they have forgotten. Guest have to remember and call the hotel in a limited period or they discard it. Weird policy. It take half a minute to call up the guest and inform them that you have forgotten your valuables. 
Then I speak to the duty manager Mr. Darshit but he gives the same reply but an added dash of Attitude. 
I was in the hotel and could have very well collected the stuff if the hotel would have been kind enough to just give me quick call but they say it does not sit well with company policy. 
So basically a horrible place to stay and eat too. And worst is dealing with the executives there who thave forgotten the concept of service.",BUSINESS,31-10-2024,JW Marriott Mumbai Sahar,78,jw marriott navi mumbai  (india )

Not my passport or even the card I used to book the reservation. When I questioned the hotel about this later, they said it was because I prepaid for the hotel. It‚Äôs not reassuring to know that anyone could‚Äôve been given my reservation and access to my room that I already paid for. In addition, my partner and I were handling four luggages, and we weren‚Äôt even offered help up to our room.

The room was not impressive at all. The queen bed was uncomfortable, and I could hear all the street noise from outside. In addition, the rug was old and the linens were rough. There were scuffs on the wall, and the sink was scratched up. This definitely wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting from a so-called luxury hotel.

On the second day of my stay, my partner was feeling sick, and we asked the hotel if there was a spot to heat up some of our food. It took twenty minutes for the front desk to answer their phone, and they told us we could heat up our food on the thirteenth floor. When we got to that floor, we were questioned what kind of food we were heating up. The workers were disdained that we wanted to heat up Filipino food. They said we couldn‚Äôt heat up our food there due to regulations, but they could give us plates and cutlery to eat with. We gladly accepted and started eating our leftovers in the dining area.

Another worker then came over to us and yelled that we couldn‚Äôt eat in that space and we had to take the food back to our room. I asked if we could take the desserts that were given out as part of their free chocolate hour back to the room with us and I was met with a resounding no. I understand there are certain regulations, but there‚Äôs no need to be rude about it. When I brought my complaints up to the deputy manager, he said that I only had these complaints because I‚Äôm American. My nationality has nothing to do with me expecting cordial and respectful service.

Housekeeping was also slow, but Elli provided great turnover service. That and the location are the only good things about this hotel.

Breakfast even though was crowded being a SUNDAY morning.. was excellent with lots of variety. All the staff go out of their way to make sure you are being served.

Some things disappointed me unfortunately :
- the breakfast : you need to pay a supplement if you want any toppings on your scrambled eggs or if you want Benedict eggs or something like this. You also need to pay a supplement if you want pancakes or waffles. I think this is a shame : I have been in many hotels around the world even hotels with less stars and I never saw that especially in hotels that cost this amount. 
- the housekeeping : I have stayed two nights. I agree with the fact that it is not necessary to change the towels but why the room is not clean ? The beds not done ? The garbage emptied ? Coffee or Tea refilled ? No one warn me that there is no housekeeping in this hotel. 

To conclude, you pay the location and only the location. And you pay it way too much. I won‚Äôt come back.",FAMILY,31-10-2024,Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London,83,park plaza westminster bridge( london) (u.k.)

The first night we were in a room with a queen bed and sleeper sofa with the latter being very comfortable. Then we switched to a larger room with 2 queen size beds. Both rooms were excellent both in size, storage and comfort. I would highly recommend the cooking class which is given at the hotel. The price includes not only learning how to make the dishes but you are then served the food you've made with wine. There are things you learn with a hands on lesson with a chef which you can not learn from a book or youtube. We loved it. Breakfast at the hotel was extensive and worth the extra cost. The first morning we went to a local cafe and go a delicious muffin but it meant leaving the hotel and standing on line to get it. The breakfast in the hotel is so much more convenient.

Sleep Quality: 5","Great staff, comfortable rooms, albeit bathroom could do with a refresh","I stayed at the Parmelia Hilton Perth for a two night layover on my way from France to Sydney. I was greeted by staff at the reception desk, and although I was a little early they worked on finding an available room for my stay. As one was not available, I was welcomed into the Executive Lounge to wait due to my Hilton Honors status. I was informed a message would be sent to me when the room was ready and my key could be collected from reception, and this occurred about 30 mins later. The room was large, clean and bright with a comfortable bed and soft furnishings. The living section room was modern, and looks like it had been refurbished within the last few years. The bathroom was also very large, with a dual sink and large shower. The bathroom however looks like it had been left out of the refurbishment, and was a little older than the rest of the room. It was starting to show signs of wear and tear, to a point where refurbishment is now required. That being said, it served its purpose well. I ordered room service through the online ordering system and it arrived within good time and was well presented, delivered by a friendly team member. 

The Executive Lounge was available to me for breakfast, and whilst simple was all I needed for the stay. On offer was the usual selection of hot dishes, cereals, breads and pastries with a self service coffee machine available along with teas, juices, water, and soft drinks. The Executive Lounge is well appointed and comfortable, it is a great offering at this hotel. Staff in the lounge were very friendly and helpful. I was advised at check in I could attend the restaurant for a small amount extra to upgrade my breakfast offering, but I opted instead to use the lounge and the offering was great. 

Around the Hotel: The hotel is located on Mill Street between Mounts Bay Road and St Georges Terrace. Close by (walking distance) is the Convention Centre and Riverside Theatre. There are cafes, restaurants and bars nearby, with a number located next door in Westralia Square. Fast food is available within a 10 min walk from the hotel on William Street. Shopping and supermarkets are also located about a 10-15min walk from the hotel.

Transportation: Trains run from Perth Airport to Perth City station (as well as from East Perth station if arriving by Indian-Pacific or the Prospector). From there you can either transfer to Perth Underground and ride one station to Elizabeth Quay and walk about 5-10 minutes to the hotel, or walk 15-20 minutes from Perth Station. The hotel is close by to the Elizabeth Quay Busport and the adjacent Elizabeth Quay Railway Station, and this can be accessed from the adjacent Westralia Square which has walkways linking the public transport facilities. Perth Busport is a 15-20min walk from the hotel and located adjacent to Perth Station. Valet parking is available on site, but I did not use this service, instead opting to arrive by train. 

This is a nice hotel with a great team who are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are modern and comfortable, albeit the bathrooms can do with a refurbishment. I enjoyed my stay and hopefully I will be able to stay here again on another trip to Perth.",SOLO,30-09-2024,Parmelia Hilton Perth,86,parmelia hilton (perth)  (australia)
Hanoi,1,,A terible expereince with hotel reception,"I had a very bad experience during my stay at Parmelia Hilton Perth on the 24th June. My staff booked 2 rooms for both of us on our business trip, direct booking under his membership with Hilton. Each room under one of us name and we arrived on different flight/time from Gold Coast and Sydney. 
When I checked in at hotel, reception staff and supervisor keep saying ""can't find my name"" but they found 2 rooms booked under my staff's name. Unfotunately I can't contact my staff at that time because my flight arrived earlier than him. Hotel staff keep me wait at hotel lobby for an hour even I told them I am very tired after a long flight 5,5 hours and I left my house at 3am. I wait and wait until 12 noon, no solution. They keep saying sorry and that's their policy (??) and they still can't find my name. I have to left hotel for our business lunch meeting at 12.30pm. When I am back at 3pm, they still not allow me checking in until they call my staff and verify his booking (he was visiting an agent). It's so frushstrated!! The way they solve problem is non of personal touch at all. I am working in hospitality for 17 years and 20 year in travel industry. I understand all policies but higher than policy it's human, it's personal touch and service from hearts. It's always has solution and never say NO to customers. I was there with all personal ID and credit card. I am not run away so they shouldn't treat me like that. 
Next day when we checked out, our staff talked to the girl name ALEXANDRA, this is the girl who's not allowed me to check in, he ask her why they couldn't find my name then she apology for the mistake (this is what my staff reported, I am not there with him).

Brendan was able to quickly diagnose some technical flaws in my groundstrokes, volleys, and serve.  More importantly, he gave me concrete, actionable advice on how to remedy the flaws and constructed specific, thoughtful drills designed to help me implement his advice.  He also carries in his tennis bag a picture book of professional tennis photos that help illustrate proper technique, and he used it to help me visualize some of the ideas he was sharing.  And I should add that it was really fun to hit with him.

- beautiful grounds, pools
- not very far from Phoenix airport
- pool bar is beautiful by night

Negatives:
- outdated rooms.  Our bathroom has the same tile and furnishings as my 15 year old bathroom, which needs gutting. 
-  bad shower, shampoo and conditioner awful. Very poor for a hotel of this class. Shower head was pathetic and cheap. 
- our room had an adjoining door which leaked light and sound. It was as if there was no door in terms of sound. 
- restaurants are expensive for what they are

This is a very big resort with many buildings and pools.  It takes a bit of time to get around. They claim you can ask a golf cart to take you places but I never saw people being driven around. We asked on the first night, as we didn‚Äôt know where we were going n the dark and with luggage in tow, and were blown off. They said it would take 5-7 minutes walking to get there and encouraged us to do so on our own. Not very hospitable! 

The beautiful pool you see in the pics is only available to 21+.  So if you have kids, you have to go to another pool.  The other pools have no food or drink service.

,1,,Racist packed in purported glitz and glam,"I visited this Resort with the intentions of having a relaxing birthday trip for my 40th bday but I quickly realized that it would be anything but that as the people (employees and guest) are racist!! I booked my room through an online booking platform and not the hotel website, this was seemingly my first offense because each and every agent made it a point to make a comment about it. Anyway when we arrived on the 25th an agent by the name of Bre checked us in, she ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù our room purportedly free of charge (my bill says different) and we were on our way. As we were walking to the room I had a feeling of being unwelcomed but brushed it off. Got off the elevator and I can tell you the hallway was in shambles, the wallpaper was peeling and it felt old and dreary. When we got to the room the bathroom was so small but the room itself was huge, from the dust on the lampshade I could tell it hadn‚Äôt been properly cleaned so I called the front desk and spoke to a lady named Dominique I explained that the room was not suitable and that I came to celebrate my birthday if I could change rooms she was nice enough called me back said she spoke with her manager and that I could get a Cabin room the next day for an extra $200 a night, I agreed because I just wanted to enough my birthday. The next day was the 26th my bday, my husband and I went for brunch and on our return to the Hotel we stopped at the ice cream shop ‚ÄúCup and Cone‚Äù. There were two ladies behind the counter a younger brunette lady and a blonde haired older lady, well I can tell you that the old lady looked at us with such disgust that I was stunned. She had an attitude and it was evident they didn‚Äôt want to serve us. We got our ice cream and left btw the ice cream was so bland in taste it wasn‚Äôt worth the money we spent. My husband and I sat in some of the chairs they had on the sidewalk and ate the ice cream we spoke of our experience and how uncomfortable it made us and I said to him ‚Äúracist really amuse me, if you don‚Äôt like people of color then just go and live off the grid‚Äù at that moment we were approached by an African American gentleman who said he was checking out because he was charged a historical fee but the people who were not of color who he came with was not charged the same fee. When he enquired why he was charged they could not give a satisfactory response, I wish to state that I too was charged the same fee at $11 a day. After that interaction I had very low hopes for the day, I went to the spa, the employees were nice however the guest all acted as if they had seen a foreign object whilst I was amused it did not make for a good day as I did not take advantage of the lounge area really and left soon after my treatment was done also the lady that did my facial was asking me some weird question in the lounge area in front of everyone as to whether or not I saw a horse in some weird sculpture I said yes so she would leave me alone and then she said hmmmm no one ever sees it I said ok and took a seat wth!! Anyway as I was to be relocated to the Cabin, I had been calling since the morning and was given the run around we even visited the front desk where the Agent reviewed the notes and laughed in our face, I was thinking what‚Äôs going on. In any event at 3:00 pm I said to my husband they are going to wait until 4:00 pm on the dot before they call us. So said so done at 4:05pm we received a call saying the room was ready a bellman would come and get our things. I can tell you that they put us at the very back of the property in a Cabin with no view and an accessibility room at this point I was too drained and disturbed to complain, whilst the room was nice, it wasn‚Äôt nice to have a shower and have the entire bathroom soaked and placed at the very back like unwanted trash. We did not bother eating at the restaurants or doing anything on premise because we just felt unwanted so we spent most of our time either in town or in the room at the back. This was by far my worst travel experience. I‚Äôve traveled the world all over Europe and the US and never have I felt so unwanted and judged.

With the name of this hotel, you expect a high-class hotel (especially for the price)

We were kindly received and helped at the reception and after checking in we immediately took the suitcases out of the car which was in the parking garage underneath the hotel.
It remains special that you have to pay to park at a hotel.
Especially with the current hotel prices, this should be free and does not feel hospitable.

The room was nice and big (but there was no place to put the suitcase, so we had to put it on the floor.

In these modern times you expect to be able to connect a laptop, Chrome cast or whatever to a TV, but it was so tightly controlled with their own system that nothing was possible.
If only the TV channels were still international, but very many German with a single English channel.

On day 1 at breakfast (which is possible until 11:00 on weekends), there was no one at the entrance on the first day and waitresses were almost running to clear the tables.
When you walk in at 10:00 you expect that the bread baskets will still be kept full, but this was not immediately the case.

Day 2 was even stranger.
We walked on again because there was no one standing there, but a waitress almost ran towards us, pressed a sheet of paper with a pen into our hand and shouted something to fill in the blank.
My name, room and signature had to be put on this. We don't know the reason for this yet.
But even stranger and not as it should be, the sheet of paper was placed on the desk but no one immediately took it away and so a name and signature were up for grabs!
And now again 2 small special rolls and only when we were about to get up to walk away did some new croissants appear.

They still navigate in that ""corona-excuses-cloud"" trying to use that for every shortcoming. Lots of discussions with staff about basic no-brainer items. Not worth listing them all here as the overall experience is just annoying. Sheraton in Germany needs to get their act back together fast - that business model is likely not going to fly for long by just hiring interns, juniors and trainees (out of which some do not understand  only basic German, English, Spanish, French, Italian) and asking the customer to pay a premium for such poor service. One good thing to point out: the Lounge happy hour that got moved to their Restaurant (as the Lounge is closed - Corona).
