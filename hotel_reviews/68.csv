Comfiest bed & pillows ever. Where can I buy them to take home !!?
The spa was huge and it was just like a scene from Pretty Woman!! AMAZING!!
The Italian food & hospitality at Firma Restaurant for dinner and breakfast was exceptional. Andrea and her smiling friendly team are a ""well-oiled machine"" and nothing was too much trouble for them. We had the most decadent time and finished off our stay with a dip in the infinity pool. What a glorious stay we had. Thank you very much and we hope to return sometime soon. Ciao for now! Xx","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/73/86/36/caption.jpg

It’s a very funky place with lots of neon, zebra designs, and videos in the lifts! The room was excellent with lots of gadgets, including a mirror which doubled as a TV! You get a great view of the city from the rooftop bar, and the hotel is ideally situated on the South Bank with it’s bars and restaurants, and close to the South Bank ferry stop for the CityCats.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/e1/64/8b/caption.jpg

The Hotel staff are very welcoming, helpful and  supportive - An example of this I was struggling to find a cake shop that could supply a nut free birthday cake and an external restaurant and Matthew  (Concierge) when out of his way to help me.  On his day off he picked up my partners cake and made sure it was kept well and presented to her in the Terrace Bar with a happy birthday tag. Also must say the music, ambiance, security staff all done very professionally. My only thing I think Emporium needs to work on is their dinner menu - MAKE IT WITH A BIT MORE VARIETY. We had 2 guest over for breakfast and only one bowl of fruits was provided for 4 of us.  That said when we asked for additional bowls of fruits they did not hesitate to provide additional bowls. Overall a great experience and will always come back to Emporium when we are in Brisbane.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-21","2024-10-21","en","Emporium Hotel South Bank","13993553","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255068-d13993553-r974882819-Emporium_Hotel_South_Bank-Brisbane_Brisbane_Region_Queensland.html"

The concierge team were so attentive and helpful (Jimmy gave us some fantastic dining options around the area). The front desk team were very friendly, wishing us a happy anniversary and messaging me when our room was ready.  
The bar staff upstairs were great to speak with and made fantastic cocktails.  Even the service by the pool and checking if we needed anything. I would highly recommend lunch at the hotel rooftop.
We loved the rooftop pool, the sauna and steam room, plus cold plunge.  
Our room was fantastic! We had the bed night sleep – the beds are extremely comfortable. The spacious area to store our luggage and the large showers were great.
Breakfast was delicious and the F&B staff were excellent. Overall, I would have to say this is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at. The location is perfect and we enjoyed walking around the Southbank markets and along the riverside in the morning.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-14","2024-10-14","en","Emporium Hotel South Bank","13993553","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255068-d13993553-r973947098-Emporium_Hotel_South_Bank-Brisbane_Brisbane_Region_Queensland.html"

It is extremely convenient  to be able to walk down and catch a fast cat into the city or lounge by the infinity pool on the 21st floor with stunning views. Really enjoyed the salmon salad we had for lunch most days as it was healthy and super delicious.
