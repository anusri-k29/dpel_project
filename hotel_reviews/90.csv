A great way to end a busy family trip travelling India. The food at the various restaurants are excellent.

The breakfast buffet offered both Indian and Western food, which we ate in the patio area, overlooking the garden. The hotel offers a number of restaurants. Of particular note was the Spice Route. where we had a delicious meal. For a more relaxed meal we also ate at the Terrace restaurant. The charming staff at the hotel were extremely efficient, catering for all our meds. This was particularly so, in the case of Atul, who could not do enough for us at the Terrace restaurant. I do not hesitate recommending the Imperial to anyone planing a visit to Delhi.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-11-03","2024-11-03","en","The Imperial New Delhi","301472","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304551-d301472-r978486395-The_Imperial_New_Delhi-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html"

I must say that the service I received from Musaleen made the experience unforgettable. I also loved the food, the service and the ambience so much at the restaurant The Spice Route that I ate there 2 nights in a row!","0","","FRIENDS","2024-09-30","2024-10-29","2024-10-29","en","The Imperial New Delhi","301472","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304551-d301472-r977180111-The_Imperial_New_Delhi-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html"

Once inside most of the noise and pollution, the rush and hustle and bustle can be put aside as you are transported to a colonial time of opulence and beauty.  Everything is stunning and attention to detail is everywhere. The artwork adorning the walls and hallways are just grand.  Furnishings polished and decadent.  Service from EVERYONE is fabulous.  The dining and bar facilities are wonderful and the people working them only too happy to help with all our your needs or requests.

The only issues were not the fault of the hotel, but rather the fault of Delhi.  Delhi truly is a disgrace and needs incredible courage, commitment, money, and community to get behind the clean up that is truly vital.  More than 20 million people are making this wonderful hotels job incredible hard.  Lying by the pool was limited by the raucousness of the busy street that is immediately behind it, but most of all by the quality of the air which can be FELT and can be TASTED and SMELLED.

I would return to this hotel in a heartbeat, but I would VERY reluctantly return to Delhi.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/ed/d8/4e/caption.jpg
