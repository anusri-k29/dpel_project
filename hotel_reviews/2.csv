And then the lie to the MINABLE Reservation","This Inn , which was very nice especially the rooms at reception , with a nice terrace. I booked one of these rooms by calling the Pension telephone number. I was in Barcelona and my interlocutor didn’t know the Inn.
When I arrived obviously, I did not have the room booked. 
On the other hand I was amazed by the carpeted hallway full of stains and the worn walls. The room at the height of the hallway , carpet unstuck, the whole very tired. I wonder how the Accor Group could let this Sofitel get so filthy. There are breaches of trust , already the Reservation , then the quality of the Inn which no longer corresponds to a Sofitel . Too bad because the location is superb , but frankly , you have to dare to rent rooms in this condition. The director agreed to this by giving me a 50% discount. But it's still expensive for a slum.","0","","COUPLES","2024-08-31","2024-09-09","2024-09-09","en","Sofitel Marseille Vieux-Port","207554","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187253-d207554-r968997343-Sofitel_Marseille_Vieux_Port-Marseille_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azu.html"

The location made it easy to explore the city on foot, and waking up every morning to a view of the old port was really nice. 

The staff is amazing - everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful.  In particular, Thomas at the front desk went above and beyond.  He accommodated my morning arrival and graciously let me check in early...even with an upgrade.  I told him it was my first visit to Marseille and was just there for two quick nights, and being able to get settled in the room early so I could explore the city made all the difference.  I'd highly recommend staying here.","0","","SOLO","2024-08-31","2024-09-01","2024-09-01","en","Sofitel Marseille Vieux-Port","207554","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187253-d207554-r967863724-Sofitel_Marseille_Vieux_Port-Marseille_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azu.html"

Good sheets without any complaint, where I started my dissatisfaction at breakfast because according to me it was included but in the final reservation did not appear, but that was not the point was that the hours were from 6:30 am to 11:00 AM and arrived with my wife at 10:15 hours and empty trays and did not repulse anything, the waitress with no manners of her own to attend offered a dish à la carte more than 30 minutes brought the cold crepe and complexion, the fried eggs burst the yolk, cold coffee and drained cups was claimed and upset, there was no one to show the food with , I was charged 33 Euros per person and we did not breakfast.
I passed my complaint at the front desk but they ignored me and charged me.
That was my bad experience at the HOTEL I booked an OPERA SUITE.","0","","COUPLES","2024-08-31","2024-08-26","2024-08-26","en","Sofitel Marseille Vieux-Port","207554","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187253-d207554-r966883795-Sofitel_Marseille_Vieux_Port-Marseille_Bouches_du_Rhone_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azu.html"
