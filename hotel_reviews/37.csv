We got an upgrade to a suite which was huge and had big windows. Only complaint is that the hotel notified us 3 days prior to arrival that renovations were commencing, so the lobby is partially blocked off, no gym, no pool, no spa. And lots of construction noise >12 hours/day, 7 days/week. Very conveniently located. Good stay, just disappointing. They should have given us some points back or charged a lower rate once the reno started.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2e/08/cc/21/caption.jpg

Room was nice, although bathroom seems half renovated as some aspects were modern and some were not so much. 

Breakfast had a decent variety of fresh food and staff are very friendly and lovely.

Room service could be improved as the refill of amenities was not very consistent and shower room had lumps of dust. 

Walls also seemed a bit thin and there was strange noise early in the morning which seemed to come from the room next door. 

Overall, nice hotel and would recommend as only encountered minor issues.","0","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-09-09","2024-09-09","en","Jw Marriott Auckland","25173995","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255106-d25173995-r968978326-Jw_Marriott_Auckland-Auckland_Central_North_Island.html"

The J W Marriott in Auckland is centrally located, just a few minutes walk from Queen Street and about 10 minutes from the waterfront and aqueduct precinct. The hotel is modern and well appointed with a choice of restaurants and bars. Trivet on the ground floor offers an excellent breakfast and has a great dinner menu and solid wine list. Room service is first rate as most of what is on the restaurant menus is available for in-room dining. The rooms are spacious, modern & clean and the gym & pool are also modern and well maintained with a view across the city to the waterfront. 
The best thing about this hotel is the staff - all staff I encountered were friendly & helpful. They are a professional team who try to anticipate your needs and nothing is too much trouble. Will stay there again on my next visit to Auckland.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/66/99/dc/caption.jpg","BUSINESS","2024-09-30","2024-09-08","2024-09-08","en","Jw Marriott Auckland","25173995","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255106-d25173995-r968795833-Jw_Marriott_Auckland-Auckland_Central_North_Island.html"

It’s near the bus and train stations, shopping areas along Queen Street, and a short walk to the Viaduct restaurants and shops along the waterfront.

We’ve been here for over a week, and it has been a very good stay.

The hotel seems to be in a transition phase. It appears that renovations to the guest rooms are almost finished, as we haven’t heard much in the way of construction noise, which the hotel’s website had warned of.

The day after we arrived, the JW Kitchen, which served food in a lobby area, closed, and a new restaurant, Trivet, opened up a stairway just off the lobby. Although the Marriott Lounge serving Marriott elite guests is still closed for renovation, it’s complimentary breakfast is now being served at Trivet. What a fantastic breakfast spread!! It offers almost everything you could want for breakfast. Although this has been a week of learning for their staff, service was good and food very, very good.

We did order from room service several nights, and the food was high quality. The only glitch was that there was a little difficulty placing a room service order, as most often no one answered the phone at the room service number, and the front desk initially transferred calls to the same unanswered line. But the front desk staff did eventually take the order, if necessary, so it all worked out. And, as I said, the food was well presented and tasty.

Staff were very attentive, friendly, and helpful throughout the stay. When we needed to make a slight change in our reservation, rather than going to the front desk, I emailed the staff person who had responded to an early inquiry before we started our trip. She promptly  made the needed changes without any problems.

Our room, on a low floor, looks out over Albert Street. Not much of a view. But the room has lots of plugs for computers, phones, etc., a small refrigerator, and a safe, which we really appreciate. There are two sets of drawers, but the drawers are all filled with hotel amenities, The bathroom features a large tub and a separate small shower. The shower gets the job done, but is just barely larger than “too small.” 

 The only thing we had trouble with was the lights, controlled by a set of four rocker switches, and getting the correct combination of lights was frustrating at times.  But that was a small detail in the overall scheme of things.

All in all, we’ve enjoyed this hotel very much, both the service, the room, the restaurant, and the location.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/3b/b4/c4/caption.jpg

We stayed in a juniors suite, it’s one of the best layouts possible, super spacious and perfectly comfortable, worth every penny. The hotel breakfast is basic, but plentiful. For some reason, there were no plain sourdough bread available on more than one occasions,  but instead there was a cummin bread, which we thought was a bit odd. The location of this hotel can hardly be beat, it’s perfectly central and very very convenient. Highly recommend.","0","","COUPLES","2024-08-31","2024-08-04","2024-08-03","en","Jw Marriott Auckland","25173995","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255106-d25173995-r963082570-Jw_Marriott_Auckland-Auckland_Central_North_Island.html"

Overall, I would say it was an average stay and property.  The views were non-existent because of the taller buildings surrounding the hotel.  The hotel in general needs a full renovation and half the rooms are already complete.  No executive lounge currently open but they do provide you with a 4-6pm happy hour and breakfast (both were average).  

My main disappointment was that they didn't tell us about the construction noise prior to booking.  They did give you a sheet upon check in stating that noise could start from 7am to 7pm.  They actually started about 6:15am which was really annoying.  Plus, there is a ton of road construction going on around the property which also adds to the noise.  

We did visit the Park Hyatt, which if I return, I would probably book because it is a newer property with better views right on the water.","0","","FAMILY","2024-07-31","2024-07-30","2024-07-30","en","Jw Marriott Auckland","25173995","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255106-d25173995-r962457254-Jw_Marriott_Auckland-Auckland_Central_North_Island.html"

It used to be the old Stamford hotel.  

Beware... The Room walls are PAPER thin. 

First room we checked into we could hear kids screaming & yelling and doors banging.  We had only just arrived, we promptly went down to reception and asked to move to a more quieter location.

The rooms seem to have been updated and were nice.  Not a fan of the uncomfortable bed.  We did hear running one night above us. Short walk to Viaduct harbour.

EVERY time we went to reception there was a LONG line of guests waiting to be served.  This is so unprofessional and totally unsustainable for your staff who were trying their best.

Things not maintained in the room.  Couldn't open the door covering the safe, couldn't close toilet door, the flick mixer tap wasn't so flickable it's was more of a force lift and grind.

We came back to our room about 4pm after being out all day, housekeeping were halfway down the hallway our GREEN Light for servicing was still lit up.  We dropped our stuff off and went out again.  When we came back to our room 6.10pm.  Our room hadn't been serviced.  As we approached the lift we spotted a staff member and asked if he was housekeeping.  We asked if he could clean our room & told him the situation.  NEVER anywhere in the world has our room not been serviced till 6pm!

We then went down to reception to ask to speak with the duty manager and we were told it was the lady behind the counter... We had to queue AGAIN!! 

The housekeeping manager came to see us in the foyer.  We were waiting for the good ole excuse your do not disturb was on and yep in fine form we were told that!!  NO it wasn't we have stayed in thousands of hotels and know how this works! 

This hotel should not be allowed to carry the Marriott brand.
