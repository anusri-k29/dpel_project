And the spa staff did not even care and just made face. Been to different spas in a hotel and this one was the only hotel we’ve been to which does not allow swim for kids even with adult supervision. Waste of money and time","0","","NONE","2024-10-31","2024-11-05","2024-11-04","en","Hyatt Regency Birmingham","193219","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186402-d193219-r978739430-Hyatt_Regency_Birmingham-Birmingham_West_Midlands_England.html"

The hotel room was spacious and had a lovely armchair with a foot stool/pouffe.
Unfortunately the spa doesn't do massages during the weekdays (when I was staying).
The swimming pool was too cold but still a relaxing atmosphere.","0","","NONE","2024-10-31","2024-11-04","2024-11-04","en","Hyatt Regency Birmingham","193219","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186402-d193219-r978720638-Hyatt_Regency_Birmingham-Birmingham_West_Midlands_England.html"

Lovely views over the city and canals. Robes in the rooms are always a great touch, as well as the use of a fridge in the room. Housekeeping were great, rooms always left in immaculate condition. We love the pool and leisure facilities here and always makes the most of them. The Hotel has a lovely peaceful atmosphere, very calming. Will definitely be back.","0","","NONE","2024-10-31","2024-11-02","2024-11-02","en","Hyatt Regency Birmingham","193219","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186402-d193219-r978344950-Hyatt_Regency_Birmingham-Birmingham_West_Midlands_England.html"

Parking at the hotel is very limited, luck of the draw. Our room was clean and comfortable, but a bit 'corporate'. Food at the bar was enjoyable and reasonably priced.

This hotel is ideally located for events at the Utilita arena, as long as you arrive by taxi / Uber. 

Overall a pleasant stay, and we would book the hotel again if going to a concert at the Utilita arena.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-29","2024-10-29","en","Hyatt Regency Birmingham","193219","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186402-d193219-r977176571-Hyatt_Regency_Birmingham-Birmingham_West_Midlands_England.html"

I had to provide the hotel with the alternative solution of offering my card details but under no circumstances to be charged - I shouldn't be the one offering solutions and your staff should be more welcoming, not arguing and having an attitude. There was no apology and no proper explanation. Communication should be key on the front desk and specifically from ""manager on duty"" as the girl said. On check out I requested my details to be completely wiped and again I met ""oh yes, I've heard what happened"" I found this comment completely inappropriate. I believe some additional training needs to be provided.","0","","FRIENDS","2024-10-31","2024-10-29","2024-10-29","en","Hyatt Regency Birmingham","193219","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186402-d193219-r977172761-Hyatt_Regency_Birmingham-Birmingham_West_Midlands_England.html"

Clean, secure, and comfortable. Breakfast was a nice spread and having access to a pool and gym was lovely. Only issue was I wish the hot water got a bit hotter that it did, and that the shower didn't spray all over the floor! An odd design choice!","0","","BUSINESS","2024-10-31","2024-10-29","2024-10-29","en","Hyatt Regency Birmingham","193219","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186402-d193219-r977155095-Hyatt_Regency_Birmingham-Birmingham_West_Midlands_England.html"

Helpful and friendly staff who made the stay very pleasant. Watch out for the showers, hard to turn on and got soaked with cold water. The lift system isn’t great either if you are with other friends or family staying on different floors as you can only access your own floor which was a major inconvenience","0","","NONE","2024-10-31","2024-10-27","2024-10-27","en","Hyatt Regency Birmingham","193219","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186402-d193219-r976892641-Hyatt_Regency_Birmingham-Birmingham_West_Midlands_England.html"

Only reasoning was we were meeting clients for a meal within the hour - Room was spacious and really clean and comfortable. Pillows were too thick. I always brink my own - other than that I would definitely recommend. Breakfast was also good and had a nice selection of foods.","0","","BUSINESS","2024-10-31","2024-10-25","2024-10-25","en","Hyatt Regency Birmingham","193219","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186402-d193219-r976562503-Hyatt_Regency_Birmingham-Birmingham_West_Midlands_England.html"
