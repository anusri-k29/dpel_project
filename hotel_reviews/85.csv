Staff - excellent and sooo accommodating. Breakfast, from early morning until 1:30PM is varied and quite good. Location, absolutely prefect. Two blocks to Champs-Elysees and many restaurants in   all directions. A quick shout-out to both Le Carre Elyee and Le Chat Blanc restaurants, both on FDR for wonderful meals AND service. Stay at the Rochester. If you do, I promise you will not regret your decision.","1","","FAMILY","2024-08-31","2024-08-31","2024-08-31","en","Hôtel Rochester Champs-Élysées","197539","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d197539-r967670197-Hotel_Rochester_Champs_Elysees-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

The hotels location is super, perfect for the shops along the Champs Élysée as it is literally a 2 minute walk.
It is also close to the underground station so great to get around Paris.
The staff were lovely, we arrived early and our room wasn’t quite ready, we were tired from travelling and we were given coffee and pastries whilst we waiting, a lovely little touch which went a long way.
Our room was lovely, we had a separate area for dressing/getting ready with a sofa, which I made full use out of.
Breakfast was good, staff really attentive. Would definitely recommend and we were so impressed we’re going back next September for our wedding anniversary.","0","","COUPLES","2023-12-31","2024-08-22","2024-08-22","en","Hôtel Rochester Champs-Élysées","197539","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d197539-r966217921-Hotel_Rochester_Champs_Elysees-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

From the comfort of my room to the hospitality of all staff and dining, the experience was memorable. I corresponded with the hotel prior to our stay and they were so helpful and kind. This is hospitality at its finest.

The beds were comfortable, air conditioning if needed was perfect, and you have a window to open to get fresh air. The only downside as an American was tub/shower. The shower handle could not be positioned for showering without spraying into the bathroom. You would have to use it as a handheld sprayer.

The pleasing food display and selection at breakfast was wonderful. The buffet was clean, service was exceptional and there were choices for everyone. 

The hotel location is a few small blocks of walking to the Champs-Elysees and all that has to offer. The metro is close as well. 
A beautiful location and exceptional stay. I will return.","2","","FAMILY","2024-07-31","2024-07-31","2024-07-31","en","Hôtel Rochester Champs-Élysées","197539","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d197539-r962497405-Hotel_Rochester_Champs_Elysees-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

Service was excellent from the minute we checked in to the minute we ckd out.    The room was exactly as pictured and was nice and clean and updated, plus it was a good size for two people with two suitcases.   The bathroom is a little tight and no way are two people getting ready in there at the same time.   We were in room 303 , it was nice and bright and we could open the window to get some fresh air and feel the weather a bit.   We did not eat at the hotel restaurant at all as we opted to try different options within walking distance from there.   Two train lines relatively close to the hotel, one is a 2 minute walk and the other about 10 minutes.   Plenty of cafes and a wonderful bakery right around the corner that had the most amazing fresh pastries.   Highly recommend this hotel!","2","","FRIENDS","2024-07-31","2024-07-12","2024-07-12","en","Hôtel Rochester Champs-Élysées","197539","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d197539-r959117449-Hotel_Rochester_Champs_Elysees-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"
