The complimentary bottle of bubbly on arrival was a nice welcome when we got to our room and late checkout was an added bonus.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2e/03/7f/52/caption.jpg

There is so many positives to highlight, including complementary mini bar of soft drinks in your room, the reasonably priced restaurants that are part of the hotels ecosystem and more importantly the quality of the rooms.

Key oints as a traveller - an iron that is clean and functional, room amenities that are regularly topped up and the customer focused team that I interacted with throughout my stay.

Love being close to QVB and light rail. Makes for an easy trip to either end of the city. Staff are always exceptional and polite. Rooms are of a good size and very comfortable.

The room was nice, bed comfortable but the bathroom had very poor lighting and no fan. The staff at the front desk was very pleasant and the concierge helpful. The breakfast offered was standard scrambled eggs, under cooked bacon, bad coffee, the fruit and breads were good. The neighborhood was lots of upscale shopping and just average restaurants. I wouldn’t stay here again stay in The Rocks, much more happening neighborhood with lots to do.","0","","FRIENDS","2024-10-31","2024-10-28","2024-10-28","en","The Grace Sydney","257296","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d257296-r976949669-The_Grace_Sydney-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html"

Great hotel with very nice large rooms in absolute top location. Conveniently located in the middle of the city and many sights within easy walking distance. Supermarket and some breakfast restaurants (many closed on weekends though) in the immediate vicinity. Only the gym may not fit the overall impression of the hotel. Once you find it, the disappointment is great.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/d9/55/52/caption.jpg
