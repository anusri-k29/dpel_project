The view from the Roof Terrace was amazing and we enjoyed our nightcap in the bar.

Sleep Quality: 5","Great Location and Amazing Views!","This was our third stay at this hotel. The location is great. It’s right next to the Tower Hill Tube station, which has lifts (nice when you have luggage). The lobby is cool. It’s large with many seating areas, books everywhere and English décor, like a toy London bus, cricket balls and a Queen Elizabeth doll. The bar staff made delicious, strong cortados. The rooms are compact, but functional with a thoughtful storage compartment under the bed. The standout features are a large, comfortable bed, plush bath sheets and amazing views. Our room overlooked the Tower or London and Tower Bridge. Some rooms have a view of The Shard. We were glad the room had a free Wi-Fi, a mini fridge and a safe. One negative: no washcloths to use the body wash provided. If you want fresh towels daily, you need to request that via the in-room iPad. The rooftop bar, which also has English-themed décor, has beautiful views of Tower Bridge, the Tower or London and The Shard from both indoors and a wrap-around terrace that has benches. The staff are very friendly and helpful. We’ll be back!","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-27","2024-10-27","en","Citizenm Tower Of London Hotel","10410272","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d10410272-r976892401-Citizenm_Tower_Of_London_Hotel-London_England.html"

Yes the rooms can feel cramped but still they're a unique experience. When other hotels kind of are the same CitizenM hits differently. It has a certain hip feeling without going too overboard going pretentious. I'm usually very skeptical with things like quotes on walls, little jokes here and there but they pull it off in a clever way and it suits my persona. 

The location of this one is very nice, the rooftop bar as well. Loved the design and their offer for ""light cleaning"" was appreciated.
