When it comes to Taj Mahal Palace,Mumbai it holds a special place in our heart as our first trip of our all india tour started with this hotel,in September 2022.We had got impeccable service and noteworthy hospitality from the staff and management which made that stay a dream come true.I recall Mr Arzaan Billimoria(their former front office manager ,now shifted to other brand)being always there for us and assisting us at every point.So at May,when our trip got completed,we shortlisted a few properties across India that we wanted to revisit another time,before heading home and Taj Mumbai topped that list.This stay was with a lot of expectations for my wife as she was very excited for this stay.I wanted to inform the property in advance about our arrival,and also wanted to request a few things to be added to our reservation.I wrote to Mr Ritesh Sharma with all the details and our requests and also informed the ihcl management regarding this stay.I got replied by Mr Ritesh the following day,who upgraded our room to an executive suite,agreed to add 4 pieces of laundry to our booking which I requested as due to travel our clothes were soiled,agreed to a celebration dinner from their side once during the stay.He also shared his direct number for any assistance.We were happy with the prompt reply understanding how efficient the gm was.He also told us he will give special price for airport pickup but didn't tell the exact price.After 2 days I got a mail from Taj Conceige requesting our time of arrival and flight details to arrange the car,and shared the special car rate(4000 plus tax)which was a 20% discount from regular rate.But as outside cars are more cheaper and knowing I will get an Uber for 1000 rs from airport to hotel,I declined the offer.At the day of arrival,few hours before boarding the flight,when we were sitting in the airport,we got a call from Mr Mayank Babla(front office manager)who said they will arrange a car for 2500 rs instead of 4k to which we said we will take it but 2.5k should be inclusive of taxes as I was reluctant to pay tax on already increased rate.He agreed to this and our car was arranged.When we arrived in Mumbai,we saw the airport manager of Taj and our chauffeur holding a placard of Taj Mahal Palace Mumbai,standing outside the airport.They quickly took our luggage and guided us to hotel car(Innova type).The journey from airport to the hotel was seamless and the chauffer was friendly and very well mannered.Upon reaching the property,we were made to enter from a separate gate(palace entry gate situated a bit away from the main gate)with Mr Babla standing in front to receive us and a front office executive who was holding a folder with our reservation details.Mr Babla quickly guided us to the main palace reception where a quick traditional welcome was given to us and then we were escorted directly to our room.It was 343.Mr Babla accompanied us and he also made us meet Mr Dhananjay Chaurasia(Their butler manager -who was my one point of contact throughout the stay),their deputy housekeeper who assured of good service during our stay and then Mr Babla left us to get settled.Someone from ird brought welcome drinks to the room.I had requested some amenities to be preplaced in the room during my booking(extra bottles,towels,dental kits,soaps etc)and I was overjoyed to see each item I requested,was placed in the room in the exact order.There was also a hand written card from Mr Ritesh Sharma,the gm in our room.Mr Ritesh Sharma shortly called us and enquired whether everything was alright or not and that he hopes we like the room.His personalised service and attention added a special touch to our stay.After resting for a while,we went to the palace lounge to have high tea(Palace lounge access was also included in my booking)The lounge is located in lobby floor,and it's unique feature was that across all the times of day,it had some snacks and soft drinks and hot drinks available.From 3 to 5 they call it high tea,from 5 to 8 it is cocktail hours and so on.and at all other times of day,hot and cold beverages are available.There is an extensive buffet of snacks, sandwiches,dry fruits,cakes,pastries for guests to snack on and indulge in.We enjoyed the snacks throughly and everything tasted great.My wife ordered a cold coffe and me a green tea.The servers were friendly and attentive.After this we went to explore the entire property and click some pictures and videos of it.There we were met with our first hurdle.While I was taking some videos of the lobby,some staff and security came rushing to me asking us to stop shooting and that it is not allowed.I was pretty disturbed as wherever we went,we take videos of the the place to keep them as a memory with us.However this was sorted quickly with a quick call to Mr Babla who made an exception for us and let us do the videos.It felt quite nostalgic to roam around the historic property and we explored the spa area(located next to tower reception, beautiful ambience and a peaceful vibe throughout),taj salon(located across the shopping arcade),their all day dining restaurant Shamiana(located at lobby level),Lebanese restaurant Souk(located at rooftop of taj towers,you will get magnificent views of Mumbais Skyline from there),their harbour bar and the Chinese restaurant Golden Dragon.The property is very well maintained exactly similar to the time we last visited,and they do daily heritage walks complimentary for taj tower and palace guests to help the guests discover the history of the palace.There are a group of palace historians for this purpose.

After exploring the entire property,it became very late for us to venture out and we returned to our room.The room was nicely cleaned while we were away,and turndown service was also done.I ordered a chicken burger from in room dining for dinner,which was delivered within half an hour and tasted pretty amazing.I also had to clean our washroom at night once and when I requested it,a very polite hk manager called Mr Ishwar came along with 2 staffs to complete it quickly.

The next day I ordered food from swiggy for lunch.As we usually stay at 5 star properties,we have to control our budget a bit and I generally prefer outside food over hotel food(can be eaten once or twice during stay,but spending on it daily will extinguish our budget)and I had requested Mr Sharma to allow swiggy food to be delivered to the room.Last time I was here,this practice was not there and outside food was completely banned.This time however I noticed they are allowing outside food but guests needed to come down to main gate to collect it.I was no exception and same was applicable to me as well.For that day and next couple of days,I ordered food from swiggy multiple times and each time it was a hassle to cross all those elevators,walk all the way across from palace reception and lobby and go to main porch to collect it.But the hassle was worth it as we were staying in an iconic property and the experience made up for the hassle.For all other requirements during the day,like hk service,plates cutleries etc from ird I just had to text the butler manager and he delivered everything swiftly across to our room.We left to visit Jio World Plaza that day and upon returning enjoyed the night view of taj and the pool at the swimming pool area.

At night they run a light and sound show kind of thing at the pool which creates a dreamy ambience there.The guests like it very much and we also enjoyed it thoroughly.The 2nd day also passed in a hppy note.The 3rd day was the day of our engagement anniversary and the staff beautifully decorated the room with designer balloons and also arranged a happy anniversary chocolate cake for us.Mr Sharma personally wished us as well and we decided to eat the complimentary celebration dinner they extended to us that day.

Also I wanted to see once all the other categories of rooms and suites present in the property and also at Taj Mahal tower.Palace had some signature suites and also the iconic Tata Suite(most expensive presidential suite in India costing 20 lakh plus taxes per day).I was promised to be shown all that after we arrive from the Mumbai tour in the evening.In the evening one of the front office lady,escorted us and we saw one basic room(grande luxury city view),one luxury suite,one signature suite Ravi Shankar and another suite Rajput Suite(made of all white marble,the best suite among all) and also their signature tata suite (651).The tata suite spans a vast area of 4500 sq ft and it the most iconic suite we have ever seen in our life.Won't get into details for privacy,but every penny spent on staying that suite is worth it.After the showround was complete,I was guided to the Golden Dragaon restaurant by their f and b manager Mr Rashid(who was working previously at Taj Falaknuma where we met him few months back).We took a table at windowside and ordered a bunch of starters and main courses from their extensive menu.Meanwhile,some managers came and handed us a flower bouquet and wished us happy anniversary.The bartender customized a special mocktail for my wife which she throughly enjoyed.The starters (baby corn,dimpsums,dry chilli chicken)were lip smacking and we tasted such delicious Chinese food after a very long time.The main courses(Fried rice,Kumpao chicken and prawn)were equally delicious as well and we cherished each one of them.This will last as a memorable dining experience for us which we will remember and cherish for a long time.

The last 2 days of the stay also passed seamlessly.Only drawback was me having to go to main porch to collect the food,rest everything was in perfect order.Every request of ours,was handled by Butler manager Mr Dhananjay who did a splendid job(never had to call palace services, everything was taken Caren of Dhananjay,just had to ping him in WhatsApp),gm was just a call away for any assistance (helped us multiple times).Hk was doing a perfect job of room upkeep,and night requests being handled by Mr Ishwar who is a very good person in hk department we saw.We also went to taj lands end once,to explore the property and Mr Sharma arranged everything personally so that we get a seamless experience.We had dinner once at sea lounge the 5th day,which also went pretty well,with friendly servers and impeccable service (Mr Rashid comped our mocktails and my green tea).Food quality and taste is well maintained in the property and price is also in line with other 5 star properties.

Another noteworthy thing was the Heritage walk that we wanted to do.Upon informing Mr Sharma,he arranged the best historian of the palace,Mr Newton D' Souza (his name is mentioned in many past tripadvisor reviews as well)for us to personally give us the tour.He is a very friendly, elderly gentleman in his early 60s who had worked in taj mumbai for 30 plus years,got retired and became the palace historian.He is also a painter(a reputed one,his paintings sell in lakhs as we got to know)but he and his family follows their role model the tata group and donates most of the money in charity.He started the tour from the Palace reception,covered the grand staircase,history of the palace and tower and many many more minute details which I won't spoil here,if you take the tour you will experience it yourself.He is a gem of a person working in the property,and i can assure every guest,if you take a tour with him,if will become a memory of a lifetime for you.

At our checkout date,the gm arranged breakfast for us as we had to leave early and also arranged a car to get us dropped to the next property we will be staying.Mr Sharma also came to meet us personally, enquired about the stay,we clicked picture with him and other managers then escorted us and our luggage to the car and bid goodbye to us.The stay ended in a very happy note and made our revisit quite memorable and very much worth it.

And last but not the least,if you want to stay at this signature taj property but still hesitating questioning the value for money prospect,let me highlight some noteworthy points which will make your decision easy-

1) Upgrades-The property being the first taj in India,and emotion for every Indian,the taj group understands and caters to it.Upgrades are provided generously,ie if you are celebrating a special occasion and inform them in advance,you can get upgraded from basic room to a sea view room or even a suite if you are lucky enough.They also upgrade people who come first time to Mumbai or staying at the property first time,to add to their delight.This is all of course subject to availability.

2)Staff Behaviour-While ihcl manages many many more palace properties in India,the royal palaces(rambagh,umaid bhavan etc)are all leased from their respective royal families and not owned by taj.This one on the other hand,is under ihcls sole ownership and their first hotel.Only the best of the best employees and manager are allowed to work here who work tirelessly for guest delight and comfort.The behaviour you will get here,will be the best among all other tajes present in India.

3)Taj Tower-Newly built,is more like a modern city hotel.The prices start at 10k,which is super low compared to taj mahal palace,But guess what,they sometimes upgrade you from tower to palace if rooms are available(atleast 15k price difference).This is a very crucial factor as they offer upgrades from budget to luxury at no extra cost.If you are lucky,who knows you can get this as well(mentioned in multiple last reviews).

4)Value for Money Prospect-Rooms start at Palace for 18k,which is pretty decent when you combine the service standards, luxury and ample space in the rooms(even the basic room starts at 400 sq ft),and when you combine the Heritage factor with all that,it's an absolute value for money prospect.(All other palaces of taj have rooms that start from atleast 35k while taj has kept prices low for this one for all people to be able to afford).    

5)Shared Amenities-If you book at tower,ie a room for 10k,you can still enjoy all facilities of the palace.The spa is the same for both tower and palace,pool is also the same(central main pool shared between guests of both properties).You can also have access to taj palace lounge if you request.and also access to all the restaurants in the property.

6)The Management-Everyone I came across,from Mr Ritesh Sharma,Mr Babla,Fom of the towers,Assistant gm evryone was polite,humble and very much guest friendly.The management works tirelessly for guest delight and amusement and all minute details are taken care of.If any issues occur,they are solved immediately.

Special thanks to Dhananjay,Mr Ishwar from HK,Mr Newton,Mr Ritesh Sharma whom we can't thank enough for everything he had done for us from those upgrades to personally being always there for us when we needed him the most(we used to call him everyday during the stay for queries).We hope to return again soon in the future.Until then,all the best.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2c/88/c4/8e/caption.jpg

We received fast room service upon our arrival at a very late hour on our first evening. We loved exploring the beautiful hotel in all of its glory from the shops, restaurants, and pool area. Kishor delivered our room service on the final day, and also responded to an issue we had with a broken suitcase zipper. He came back to our room with tools and was able to repair our baggage in fast order as we began our trip home to the US. He was extremely kind and we enjoyed exchanging some nice conversation in addition to his service. Ariba, who was as ""sunny"" as the meaning of her name, checked us out was extremely personable sending us out on a nice note. Everyone else we encountered was nothing but kind and helpful as well.

Excellent spread for both veg / non veg in a well laid out buffet . Thr Bombay Dahi Papri was superb - eat without fear of infection!!! The exotic Tea was so fragrant , and the cakes were delicious.

Worth the Rs 3500 per head . Ambience , sea view , good food & polite service makes it a must-do when visiting Mumbai!","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-11-03","2024-11-03","en","The Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai","302179","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d302179-r978510008-The_Taj_Mahal_Palace_Mumbai-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html"
