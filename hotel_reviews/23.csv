Highly recommend.
He even went above and beyond to create a mocktail that was not on the menu. 
Food as usual great
Salmon was fresh 
And the recommendations by Mr Samir was perfect.
From starter to dessert, we felt pampered.","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","en","Le Suffren Hotel & Marina","572872","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293817-d572872-r978153101-Le_Suffren_Hotel_Marina-Port_Louis.html"

The spa is quite enough to relax but clearly busy enough due to the quality of their massages. I have been coming here since 2014. The showers are clean the pool sparking and the gym has enough equipment for a good, but not too strenuous holiday workout. 

Dimples hands worked magic.

They don't charge you for the simplest minute or hour if you just visit like I did with my father since he's leaving the country. The bar I can recommend since I drank Appletiser and felt like a millionaire at the same time. As a local, I can advise. Remember, behind the bar: men toilets. Next door: female toilets. If you're staying and not driving, drink the alcohol. Overall: use it as a restaurant for the experience. Stay no need.","0","","FAMILY","2024-09-30","2024-09-22","2024-09-22","en","Le Suffren Hotel & Marina","572872","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293817-d572872-r970852861-Le_Suffren_Hotel_Marina-Port_Louis.html"

Great hotel with very nice rooms. Clean and with good space. Very pleasant and professional service, both in the front desk and in the restaurant. Great location close to the center of Port Louis. Free Taxi boat takes you across the canal to downtown almost anytime you want. Will to the beach is closest about 30 min drive. The airport is about 45 min drive away. Highly recommended.","0","","BUSINESS","2024-08-31","2024-09-05","2024-09-05","en","Le Suffren Hotel & Marina","572872","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g293817-d572872-r968378814-Le_Suffren_Hotel_Marina-Port_Louis.html"

There is a free water taxi to ferry you across to the waterfront area with shops and restaurants, which is a fun way to reach the hotel. The food and drink are very good. Every single member of staff was smiling, pleasant and attentive which really makes for a happy stay. Rooms are beautiful and clean. There is a gym and a lovely pool and spa area. Lots of spots to sit by the water and enjoy the view over Port Louis. This is not a beach hotel but it’s a great base for exploring Port Louis.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/3a/dc/b4/caption.jpg
