From stepping in the door we were greated with warmth and care. This hotel is family run and Exceeded our expectation. The friendliness of the staff and owner were exceptional. Being the last hotel on our 8 week holiday this ended our trip  with a huge positive vibe.  If I'd known how good I would've booked longer. 
Breakfast was convienant, they had a small cosy bar also, open to hotel guests and walk ins. 
We met some lovely travellers as the vibe was super friendly.  Not a bad impression or thought about our stay. 
In the room stated towels not serviced daily, but ours were. Had a working safe., a mini fridge, haur dryer and a bath to relax after all the sight seeing.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/e4/33/3b/caption.jpg

Beautiful views of the Eiffel Tower from the Bir Hakeim bridge are about a five minute walk, and you can run or walk along the Seine for miles, also with a five minute walk.  Like many places in Europe, the rooms tend to run on the small side - but it's Paris for Gawd's Sake, so how much time are you going to spend in the room anyway?  The staff are downright incredible:  Jean Claude, Miriam, Melanie, Wilfred at night - all of them - are downright terrific.  This is the only hotel we would consider staying in should we return to Paris.  GO!  You will not be disappointed!","0","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-09-28","2024-09-28","en","Hotel Eiffel Seine","572984","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d572984-r971720050-Hotel_Eiffel_Seine-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

I was able to get in email contact with the hotel very easily and the staff were wonderful in answering my questions and helping to make my stay perfect. I arranged to be collected at the airport and the gentleman who picked me up (and dropped me off when leaving) was very friendly and helpful. The friendliness and helpful ways of all the staff continued throughout my stay and I’d like to say a particular thank you to Myriam. I was given a room on the ground floor which was lovely; the room and ensuite were a good size, well furnished and decorated.  The only small problem I had was there was no grab rail to hold onto going down the 2 or 3 steps in the sunken bath to have a shower so, being nearly 80, I had to be very careful when having a shower. Breakfasts were good and I particularly enjoyed the fresh croissants.  The hotel is close to the banks of the Seine, 10 minutes walk from the Eiffel Tower and has a few restaurants close by. There is a nice little bar in the reception area, and a lovely little courtyard outside my room, where I enjoyed few quiet gin & tonics during my stay. How lucky I was to find such a wonderful small hotel.","0","","SOLO","2024-07-31","2024-09-25","2024-09-25","en","Hotel Eiffel Seine","572984","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d572984-r971311870-Hotel_Eiffel_Seine-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

Very friendly staff, always helpful and friendly reception, good breakfast both sweet and savory. The only downside is that the towels were not changed between days.  Recommendation also because it is 5 minutes walk from the Eiffel Tower, close to metro and grocery.
The gem and mascot of the hotel is the cat Lilly, always ready to receive some caresses.","0","","COUPLES","2024-08-31","2024-08-24","2024-08-24","en","Hotel Eiffel Seine","572984","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d572984-r966509757-Hotel_Eiffel_Seine-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

I was directly across the street from the metro and also where the Seine boat tours took off from.  The room was great and comfortable. Jean-Claude at the front desk was so nice and helpful. 
Thanks! If I ever make it back to a Paris I will probably stay there again.","1","","SOLO","2024-08-31","2024-08-17","2024-08-17","en","Hotel Eiffel Seine","572984","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d572984-r965236025-Hotel_Eiffel_Seine-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

The hotel is just a 1 minute walk to the Seine, 5 minutes to the Eiffel Tower, and steps from two Metro Stations, taking you anywhere in Paris. There is a grocery store down the block, and plenty of cafes nearby.  Audrey prepares a delicious breakfast with fresh eggs, pastries, pancakes, meats and cheeses, as well as yogurt, fruit and juices. Jean Claude and Melanie booked us a wonderful dinner cruise, and gave us good travel advice and dinner suggestions during the Olympics. In the evenings, we enjoyed laughs and specialty cocktails made by Wilfred at the bar. The rooms are small but neat and clean, and have a TV, safe, closet, refrigerator, and great hot water in the shower.  We enjoyed our stay in Paris, and the warm welcome and kindness that we received from everyone working at Hotel Eiffel Seine. We will be back!","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/27/7a/dd/caption.jpg","FAMILY","2024-08-31","2024-08-15","2024-08-14","en","Hotel Eiffel Seine","572984","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d572984-r964877122-Hotel_Eiffel_Seine-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"
