Nothing was ever too much as they all made such an effort to provide the best service we have had in any hotel. We shared laughter and smiles all round from the children to the grandparents. The gentleman at the door who greeted us at the car was lovely, so was the person who brought our bags up. We would find the lady near the door would always have a chat when we waited for our taxi, pleasant and provided us with some tips for our day trips. Our favourite team of all was the ones on 41st floor Soad, Janet, Keith, Rajiv, Saw, Karim, Jmaya, Aung, Kopilo and Kathy. Every time we came for breakfast, afternoon tea or happy hour they definitely made us happy. Soad even made us a card, put up balloons and decorated our table, which was such a sweet touch and made us feel very special. My parents in their 70s who have traveled a lot, have not stopped talking about how amazing, attentive and accommodating the staff were and that means a lot to me as i booked it to make sure everyone had a good time, which they all did and we will definitely come back again.","0","","NONE","2024-10-31","2024-11-05","2024-11-05","en","Shangri-La Dubai","302098","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d302098-r978824128-Shangri_La_Dubai-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

This time, I tried Shangri La Hotel which is located on Sh. Zayed Road. This is my first time in this hotel but tried Shangri La before in different cities. The hotel is located in a strategic walkable area with plenty of shops, restaurants, and cafes and its proximity to Dubai Mall. Check-in was so smooth. I was given a wonderful room on the 30th floor facing Sh. Zayed Road. The room has all the amenities that any traveler needs. Extra-things like shaving kit .. etc can be ordered from the reception. The room was of decent size and very clean. The bed was so comfortable for sleep and the room has excellent sound proof. I barely hear anything from outside. The bathroom was also of reasonable size and very clean. I particularly enjoyed their toiletries. The scent is so fresh. The shower has strong pressure which leaves you fresh.  My only issue is that the room has no dedicated USB socket for charging. The breakfast is served at Dunes Cafe in the first floor. It has a variety of options that suits every palate Also this restaurant hosts speciality buffet nights. For seafood lover they have a wonderful buffet on Friday evening. There were suppose to be two restaurants on the second floor but I believe they are under renovation. The first floor has two other restaurants, Chinese (Shang Palace) and Vietnamese (Hoi An) but I didn’t try them. On the same floor there is the Balcony Bar. Their spa and the outdoor pool are located on the 4th floor, while there is another indoor swimming pool in the 43th or 44th floor (I don’t remember now!). Both swimming pools are ordinary and the signs of aging clearly is shown on both facilities. I guess the highlight of my stay was the wonderful staff. The staff were friendly everywhere. I particularly remember Kunga at the reception which did everything possible to make my stay very comfortable from smooth check-in process. She was helping me and other customers with a big smile and genuinely she has a great passion in her work. I remember I tried to log-in to my Shangri-La app but for some reason I couldn’t do that and I needed series of verification without success. I told one of the staff at the reception about this issue and she gave me 1-800 number to dial. However, after 30 minutes I mentioned this issue to Kunga during my check-out process and she managed to call Shangri-La management and within exactly two minutes my app was working again. Overall, nice hotel and I enjoyed every aspect of it. The management has to be proud of their staff. Personally, I like to change hotels when I come to Dubai just to have different experiences each time but definitely this is a place I would love to try again and obviously highly recommend for solo travelers couples and families.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/4f/16/2b/caption.jpg

Club lounge is great for breakfast, afternoon tea and evening food, probably the best we have ever experienced in a club lounge. The suites are huge with second toilet, dressing room between bedroom and bathroom and so much storage. Complimentary shuttle buses take you to Dubai Mall and beach. The metro is a short walk or you can get taxis easily. I really enjoyed swimming early evening when the pool area was lit up. The staff throughout the hotel are so welcoming and helpful.
