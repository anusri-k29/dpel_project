Scott, Marleina, Charae from front desk were so friendly and pleasant to speak to. We had no issues checking in. Our server Joshua from Alaia was so upbeat and made our day. He offered us the Kamaaina discount along with anniversay mimosas. Kawena was very helpful with booking an activity for us. There were so many staff members that go unnoticed. They were working hard to make sure the hotel was clean. Thank you to all of the employees for giving us the best anniversary stay. We appreciate your efforts.  The worst part was having to pack up and leave. We love it here. See you all in December.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2e/08/63/41/caption.jpg

Having regularly stayed at St. Regis locations, and having stayed at the Ritz Carlton Waikiki on this same rim, I can frankly say this property is not up to par with what I would expect from a five start resort.  It's location of course is unbeatable, but for value and service, I'd rather be at the Ritz Carlton Waikiki and would certainly skip this property the next time.

Check in went smoothly, if not a little long.  I asked about my suite night award, which I have yet to use this year, and was told there were no upgrades available - but they offered me of course to pay the $150 p/p ($300 a night for my stay) to use the Club Lounge (which would've come included with a suite night award).  Very disappointing to see so little care for Marriott Bonvoy (platinum member) members.  Honestly, they just didn't seem to care.  The club was nice but to be frank, a bit nicer than an airport lounge.  We tried the snacks for breakfast/lunch/dinner and the most bang for your buck is definitely breakfast (though no mimosas or alcohol which is tacky).  Lunch was no more than a United club lounge at an airport, just better presentation.  Some chicken/avocado wraps and spam sushi rolls.  Dinner apps were okay with a great charcuterie spread and wine available.  The biggest issue is the club isn't open all day - for that price, I should be able to get cocktails or sodas anytime of the day.  Super disappointing.  Overal, I don't think we got our $300 value, but if you can drink your share at dinner, you should definitely go for it.  Drinks at the resort at the pool and elsewhere are outraegiously priced and they have a captive audience.

The room itself was unimpressive and did not have the feel of luxury I would expect from this sort of property.  To give an example, that bathroom was very sparse with hardly any toiletry amenities or ""welcome"" towels laid out.  When we checked in at the Ritz Waikiki, the bathroom was fully stocked (including a scale) and had welcome mats in front of each of the sinks, all the high end toiletries and just felt luxe the minute you walked in.  

Service at the hotel was average. It felt like folks were definitely working for your tip as opposed to doing everything to give you an amazing experience.  The Ritz Waikiki was the exact opposite - everyone seemed just fixated on ensuring you were having a memorabe time, tip or no tip. Honestly, the folks at Turtle BAy should be shaddowing the staff at the Ritz Waikiki.  It is night and day for service, anticipating your needs, and just absolute luxury you'd expect.  On top of which, the facilities at Turtle Bay are old.  The patios still have metal grate type balconies as opposed to have clear glass (which provides a nicer view to the ocean).  You also look out at the roof of a large building (towards the ocean) that they haven't even bothered to put grass on or attempt to dress up in anyway.  

Overall loved the location and view but would rather spend my money elsewhere.  Just didn't feel like a Ritz Carlton at all and was disappointed.","0","","FAMILY","2024-11-30","2024-11-04","2024-11-04","en","The Ritz-Carlton O‘ahu, Turtle Bay","87158","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60651-d87158-r978716570-The_Ritz_Carlton_O_ahu_Turtle_Bay-Kahuku_Oahu_Hawaii.html"

We stayed 10 nights and absolutely nothing disappoints! Full transparency? We were supposed to stay at the Hilton, but showed up and everything was on strike. Was told we would have no housekeeping or restaurants and we were absolutely no way. Cancelled right there. My husband pulled out his laptop and we were on our way to a much better adventure.  

Turtle Bay has now set the standard. Bravo. Better beach, close to a lot of wonderful things. 20 minute drive to Halewaia, check out the food trucks at the sugar mill, snorkel at Turtle Bay, Sharks Cove, or Pupukea Beach. Do many things to do. And don’t forget to use the bikes or visit the stables.","0","","FAMILY","2024-11-30","2024-11-01","2024-11-01","en","The Ritz-Carlton O‘ahu, Turtle Bay","87158","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60651-d87158-r978212820-The_Ritz_Carlton_O_ahu_Turtle_Bay-Kahuku_Oahu_Hawaii.html"

We loved it!
Last time I stayed it wasn't ritz Carlton and I don't see much difference other than price. Thank goodness for Marriott points. Don't know that I would pay $600/ night kamaaina rate.
That being said.....
Room was nice,quiet, and comfortable. View was spectacular.
Lagoon wasn't too busy and jumping in the ocean was just what we needed!
Restaurants on site are good.  Beachhouse was a really good dinner and off the lip a relaxing bar with live music. The breakfast buffet was meh for the price. 
At least it wasn't crowded like waikiki.

Visited 6 years ago & chose to return to celebrate an anniversary. This resort is stunning from top to bottom. The price tag is absolutely worth every cent. The views, the service, the decor, the pools,the surrounds,the peacefulness, everything here is top notch. I'd like to thank the management for the complimentary champagne & dessert tray on arrival in our room after they learned of our celebration.

And that's exactly what Ritz-Carlton can be paid for on the one hand.....as far as so good, everyone can decide in advance whether the sum called up is also worth it........as long as the service fits. And this is exactly where we have clearly happed. Starting with the check-in, which did not work out at 3 pm, to the suitcases, which were still not there at half past seven in the evening via a double occupancy of our room (suddenly another family was standing in the room). The complex is very nice, however we felt the pool was no longer contemporary. Small and in itself he had little to offer. What I also can't understand is why you don't even get a welcome drink on arrival (at the room rate????!!!!). The kukui nut or shell necklace we got at the reception only over the counter, and were allowed to hang it ourselves............honestly, that does not create any aloha feeling! Overall we were unfortunately disappointed with the stay. In summary: Location as well as hotel great, service and value for money miserable.","0","","FAMILY","2024-08-31","2024-09-01","2024-09-01","en","The Ritz-Carlton O‘ahu, Turtle Bay","87158","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60651-d87158-r967798798-The_Ritz_Carlton_O_ahu_Turtle_Bay-Kahuku_Oahu_Hawaii.html"

We drive over 1hr from Pearl with our son who is in the NAVY there and rent chairs and then enjoy dinner at the resort when not staying on this side at RITZ CARLTON.  But today we have 6 family with us celebrating 2 birthdays at Alaia and came over early to enjoy the beach before dinner and they told us they have CHANGED their POLiCY and now non-guests can no longer rent chairs or umbrellas.  This is narrow thinking for a LUX brand and the wrong answer to frequent guest and restaurant visitor. Disappointed in the RITZ brand, and perhaps why other line Pendry, Auberge and Rosewood are getting better.  Hope this note provides opportunity to re-think policy and how guests experience the resort when not staying on North Shore.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/52/e6/35/caption.jpg","FAMILY","2024-09-30","2024-08-31","2024-08-31","en","The Ritz-Carlton O‘ahu, Turtle Bay","87158","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60651-d87158-r967734850-The_Ritz_Carlton_O_ahu_Turtle_Bay-Kahuku_Oahu_Hawaii.html"

It is modern, very well taken care of and the grounds are huge! 
We stayed in an Ocean Front Club King room which included access to the Ocean Club Lounge. That Lounge is worth every penny. I highly recommend it. 
The room was spacious and quite clean, well taken care of. 
The beach area was also great, although it needs more cleaning as there was some trash around where the waves broke. The beach is open to the public and if you get there late, you won’t find a good spot. I also think that it would have been nice if the exclusive area was only for guests and free. That area was frequently empty as no one wants to pay more than what we are already paying for our rooms and also pay for a tiny private area in the beach. The Ocean Club Lounge was great, great food and paid for by the room reservation. It’s absolutely worth it. 
I really loved this hotel as it was secluded from the buzz of Honolulu. I also hope that now that Marriott acquired this hotel and is called the Ritz Carlton, they continue taking care of it. I would go back in a heart beat.","1","","COUPLES","2024-02-29","2024-08-28","2024-08-27","en","The Ritz-Carlton O‘ahu, Turtle Bay","87158","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60651-d87158-r967132212-The_Ritz_Carlton_O_ahu_Turtle_Bay-Kahuku_Oahu_Hawaii.html"
