The rooms are a good size, comfortable beds, hot showers, great housekeeping and all the staff are super friendly. It’s a big hotel and a nice oasis from the hustle and bustle of Delhi in a  location for sightseeing. Room was on the 25th floor with an amazing view , a good selection for breakfast and we ate out each evening. Would book again.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-11-02","2024-11-02","en","The Lalit New Delhi","299120","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304551-d299120-r978445596-The_Lalit_New_Delhi-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html"

No complaints. Housekeeping staff were friendly and generally kept things clean. The restaurants were super expensive. One adult dinner buffet was around 3200-3500 (that’s about 40. Daal Tadka and White Rice will cost you 2500. The staff at the restaurant are always in chaos mode even if more than 60% of the tables are empty. Seated me at a table with no silverware, glass anything and I initially waited or asked but then eventually got up and grabbed from another table a bit away. Breakfast buffet spread were almost identical for the 3 mornings I was here. Overall I had high hopes with an upcoming family trip back to Delhi in December, but I’m pretty certain that I’ll look elsewhere. PS: remember to ask them to remove the service charge in all the bills, that’s optional and I tipped the staff separately (yes even after all the neglect, I still tipped them; don’t ask me why.","0","","SOLO","2024-10-31","2024-11-01","2024-10-31","en","The Lalit New Delhi","299120","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304551-d299120-r978197479-The_Lalit_New_Delhi-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html"

It is a very busy hotel, well located if you want to walk to Connaught Place. Nice pool but no poolside service. Rooms clean and adequate but would not describe it as 5-star or luxury. Attitudes of reception staff vary - a couple very helpful and friendly.  Slow check-in and check-out.

We arrived before 10:00am after a couple of long-flights. Check-in time at the hotel was stated as 14:00 but both the guide who dropped us at the hotel and one of the hotel staff where hopeful that rooms would be cleaned and available by 12:00 noon. We waited until 12:00 and during this time asked twice if we could have access to Wifi but were told that was not possible until a room had been allocated. At noon I approached the desk again, with half our party asleep in the lobby. I was reminded of the 14:00 check-in time and told that no Deluxe rooms would be ready until at least that time. However, we could have Executive rooms available immediately. In a moment of sleep-deprived weakness I agreed to being ‘upsold’ these rooms. This cost us 26,880 INR (about 300 EUR) for 3 rooms for 2 nights (in effect for the 2 hours from 12:00 to 14:00 - if they were going to ‘upsell’ at least they could have done it at 10:00 and we could have benefited from 4 hours!). 

I think the ‘Executive’ rooms and the ‘Deluxe’ rooms are pretty much the same (we had a Deluxe room when we returned at the end of the tour and it appeared to have the same facilities albeit a slightly different layout). The benefit the ‘Executive’ rooms appear to have is access to a lounge on the top floor for buffet food and cocktails for a few hours in the late afternoon and early evening. I didn’t understand what the receptionist said about the access to the lounge when she upsold the rooms so we missed out on visiting it the first night. By the second night I had worked out that the lounge was available so we set off for complimentary cocktails on 28th floor. Although billed as a ‘Cocktail lounge’ when we got there the server said that actually they didn’t do cocktails. There was only a small selection of spirits available (one variety of whiskey, one variety of vodka etc.) We could not eat the buffet food available as we are vegan and there didn’t appear to be anything without dairy etc. 

On our first morning we received a strange letter under the door which stated that they enclosed our room bills and would we settle it at our earliest convenience. No bill was enclosed with the letter. When we went to reception to query this we had a surreal conversation which was basically us querying the letter and the receptionist stating that there was a meeting arranged with our travel group that we should attend (??). We asked why we needed to attend this meeting, she said that she didn’t know and that we would have to attend to find out….(it turned out it was a completely different travel group and nothing to do with us!).

The reason we choose this hotel in particular was that it has a vegan restaurant and we thought it would be good to be able to go to the restaurant in the hotel and know everything was vegan without having to explain what we do and do not eat etc. It turns out that the ‘Vegan haven’ isn’t open in the evenings. It is called ‘Le Petit Café’  and appears to be having a bit of an identity crisis  in that when you approach the restaurant the first thing you see is a cabinet of lovely looking cakes - but none of these are vegan. They do have a short menu consisting of salads, wraps and a burger and some ‘mini-bites’ such as crispy cannelloni and bruschetta. We had the burger and all agreed it was the worst meal that we had while we were in India. An idea to improve the vegan offering is that it would be great if they could have a menu of vegan Indian street food - so you would know it was vegan and safe to eat…..(we won’t charge for that idea!).

At breakfast they had an extensive buffet, the vast majority of which was labelled as having milk in it. Once we asked the manger how we could find vegan food, the chef came out and was very helpful making dosas and idli and other vegetable preparations. We managed to get decaffeinated coffee on our first morning but by the second morning we were told that they had run out of decaffeinated coffee (they used instant sachets). 

The highlight of our visit to the Lalit was the Baluchi restaurant. The serving staff, the chef and the sommelier were all very helpful and knowledgeable about vegan food and wine and we had excellent food and drink there in a great restaurant.

On our return to the hotel for one night at the end of the tour, again the check-in was slow. There was a Halloween party that night and they appeared keen to sell us tickets at the desk (and then I think my son got at least two calls to his room). Focus seemed to be on ‘upselling’ again rather than customer care.

When we checked-out of the hotel to go to the airport we left before 07:00 and didn’t have breakfast - others had been offered a package of food to take with them but they didn’t appear to be able to do that with vegan options. 

I don’t know if the hotel offers an option to pay for early check-in (we didn’t book the hotel directly it was done through a travel agent) but it would be good if they offered that option. What would be even better would be if you could ‘trade’ an early check-out when you leave for early check-in when you arrive …… but I guess that would never happen as it would be in the customer’s interests and not the hotel’s!!","1","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-30","2024-10-30","en","The Lalit New Delhi","299120","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304551-d299120-r977658494-The_Lalit_New_Delhi-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html"

The rooms and housekeeping is terrible .
Our room was very dusty , not cleaned at all , only beds made and fresh linen and toiletries placed . The shower drainage flooded within seconds of starting shower .
There was dust visible everywhere . I got the carpet by the bed removed and there was so much dust underneath that housekeeping returned to mop it !!!! And he apologized for the dust . 
At Checkout , Ishaan did ask us about the room and we told him the same . He noted it down to convey to the housekeeping .","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-30","2024-10-29","en","The Lalit New Delhi","299120","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304551-d299120-r977287968-The_Lalit_New_Delhi-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html"
