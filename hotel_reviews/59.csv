Die Zimmer sind sehr groß und sehr sauber. Die Betten sind sehr bequem. Unser Zimmer wurde zweimal am Tag hergerichtet. Das Frühstück war sehr reichhaltig. Die zentrale Lage war top. Man konnte gut zu Fuß die Dubai-Mall, den Burj Khalifa und die Fontänen erreichen. Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt sehr genossen.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2e/08/89/0a/caption.jpg","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-11-05","2024-11-05","de","Taj Dubai","7309237","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d7309237-r978802098-Taj_Dubai-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

Dates of Stay: 21 August to 31 August, 2024
This visit to Dubai was special  as we had great memories in previous stay in July 2024 for 15 days. I was so happy that after my first ever visit to Dubai in July 2024, this second visit came so soon and I was going to witness the great hospitality of Taj Dubai Burj Khalifa Street again.
This time I took the liberty to ask Mansi Mam directly to favor me with a booking and she was so prompt in getting it done with confirmation as well and got call from hotel as well. They ensured that I get the room with best view and members rate as well being TIC member.
When I checked in front office ensured that I get best of the room in facility.Surely 2905 was the best for sure with Burj Khalifa view..
Staff at front is very welcoming and always ready to help guests with smile which makes guests so comfortable. I liked the traditional welcome with Tulsi Mala, gives a great feeling and attachment to our culture.
To thank in person I would like to mention the staff at reception in evening during my check in on August 21,2024. Mansi Mam was personally there as well.
The best part of this facility is that we see feeling of homeliness right from top to bottom and GM Mr Arora leads from front. He personally ensured I have a pleasant stay with my choice of food during stay. 
The best part of my stay was to experience the lounge services off and on as well during my tight schedules, there also staff is amazing- Mr. Sidhartha and for great care and arranging without onion snacks during my visits..
I experienced some great hospitality and best of cuisines in Floor 3 during my breakfasts. Staff were highly caring, to name few Anurag/Akhilesh/Aastha/Sarita/Ritik and few others. Specially they were so welcoming and caring to ensure that we are fed well. They were up to the task that I get without onion meals everyday. 
Special thanks to Chef and his team for taking care of my choice. It was a great experience overall to enjoy exclusive dishes with best of Chefs there. 
I am missing many other names whom I would like to thank personally for making my stay memorable again and it strengthened my bonds further with Taj.

Spa and fitness staff is amazing. I must appreciate Mr Vishnu, Ms Maya and Ms Phoo for their great care and hospitality. Even Anil was very active to serve.
Even the security staff and support staff were so caring and welcoming right from the day of check in to check out.
One suggestion, please change your conditioner bottles in bathrooms as it is very hard to take out from small hole as it is not liquid.

Opted to take the hotel transfer from the airport and was met at arrivals as arranged. 
Probably the largest room we have ever stayed in, with a huge bed, bathroom with separate bath and shower with his and hers sinks. Luxurious Molton Brown toiletries provided.
Our room was on the 32nd floor and the views were amazing, we didn’t need to go up the Burj Khalifa as we had the views from our room.
Excellent breakfast taken on the 26th floor with more awesome views.
The hotel shuttle to and from the Dubai Mall was very welcome as it was too far to walk.
Very helpful concierge looked after our bags after checkout and helped us to get a car to our next destination.
A stunning hotel. Friendly, helpful staff made our stay in Dubai just perfect.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2e/00/88/90/caption.jpg
