The staff is attentive, and the ambience is both luxurious and welcoming. I highly recommend visiting their rooftop bar for stunning city views.

Refused entry to Bar in 35 degrees in shorts, rooftop bat does not open until 5pm. Beer price on in room application 450 rupee, go to bar and it is 700. Exorbitant alcohol prices that cannot be justified. Guest treated with disdain. Now checking whether there is a glitch that has caused more than 40% increase. Will not be staying at Oberoi again","0","","COUPLES","2024-11-30","2024-11-05","2024-11-04","en","The Oberoi, New Delhi","304216","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304551-d304216-r978751261-The_Oberoi_New_Delhi-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html"

No wonder Oberoi sets the standard high. The moment we entered, the welcoming with garlands, customised sweets, welcoming toy, cookie baking session, mocktail session you name it,breakfast and dinner at 360, staff service, the leadership, what else, all of them worked like a machine with enthusiasm and energy to keep the service level high. I know it takes a whole village to keep a hotel like Oberoi with a consistent service level, but I have to name a few whom we interacted the most. First to start with is Aditi, the leader at the front desk, I would say, she pulled off all those sessions to keep my kid active inside the hotel itself and that too in between the busy schedule of Diwali. Thank you Aditi. Our daughter will always cherish those sessions. Gave us parents also our ""We time"". Next is Jinesh from reception, who arranged our early morning departure to hotel and made sure everything is fine. Sumant from 360 along with his colleagues were just amazing to keep our energy high towards the end of the day during dinner time, and ofcourse with a welcoming smile during breakfast. Thank you Won at the bar for the mocktail session and Muskan at the bakery for the baking session. Our daughter will cherish these memories. Few more names, Nishant, Nokpon, Shangley, thank you all. The house keeping team, I do not know your names, but hats off and thanks, the moment we stepped out of room, i could see the team cleaning and making the room as if fresh. Thank you To the security, conceirge staff, and all others, thank you all. Till we meet again, thank you !

They operate at a different level when it comes to service;  I have not seen or received service like this at any Canadian, US or European hotel!  This service is every part of the experience from room service, the laundry, the restaurant etc.

They are expensive,  but you get what you pay for!  It is definitely worth the price!  

Everything in the room was clean and elegant!

I would very highly recommend the Oberoi!","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-11-04","2024-11-04","en","The Oberoi, New Delhi","304216","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304551-d304216-r978644930-The_Oberoi_New_Delhi-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html"

They went out of their way to make sure we felt at home. 
So sweet profesional and helpful. We went to the temple, to the market and to explore other hotels 
The food at the Boshua Chinese restaurant was delicious. The spa visit required to us to go again. We loved the treatment so much we had to go back.

The building is a little dated  and a little run down but the services is so good that you don’t notice.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","en","The Oberoi, New Delhi","304216","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304551-d304216-r978124372-The_Oberoi_New_Delhi-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html"

I stayed here for two nights and had two of the best nights sleep I have ever had. The beds are so comfortable! The rooms are spotlessly clean and all the amenities are great. The staff take such good care of you and nothing is ever too much trouble. Would highly recommend if you're staying in Delhi.","0","","BUSINESS","2024-10-31","2024-10-30","2024-10-30","en","The Oberoi, New Delhi","304216","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304551-d304216-r978028219-The_Oberoi_New_Delhi-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html"

From its service, food and facilities it oozes class and confidence. Impeccable and friendly staff cover your every wish. The outdoor pool is a haven of relaxation and the rooms are divine.

The design is cutting-edge, with an industrial-chic vibe that feels both edgy and welcoming. The rooftop bar is the hottest spot in town, with craft cocktails and live DJ sets. But it's not style over substance - the rooms are comfortable, the staff are genuine and helpful, and the location is unbeatable. It's the kind of place that makes you feel cooler just for staying there.","0","","FRIENDS","2024-08-31","2024-10-27","2024-10-27","en","The Oberoi, New Delhi","304216","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304551-d304216-r976790825-The_Oberoi_New_Delhi-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html"
