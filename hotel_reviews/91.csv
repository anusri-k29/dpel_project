The last was Le Sirenuse pre pandemic and I think the Treasury has superseded that because it has the wonderful service and plushness expected of a luxury property but without the vulgarity of bling , ostentatiousness  or being over the top. For an architectural buff like me, it was heaven on earth !

It’s poetry at every turn , and around every corner … photos don’t do it justice… the lighting  and volume of space, the lines and angles ; everything is thoughtfully  choreographed and nothing is left to chance and yet it’s so natural and comforting … for goodness sake, there aren’t many hotels out there that have Vola fixtures in the bathroom . it’s a playground for OCDs like me! 

It was really tough for me to peel myself away from the Como to go out to see the lovely city of Perth …","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2c/cb/dc/3a/caption.jpg

The building itself is incredible and loved the grandeur feel, but with the class and history that is years in the making.
My only suggestion would be to have better chairs/lounge chair for room 2.","0","","COUPLES","2024-05-31","2024-06-12","2024-06-12","en","COMO The Treasury","8490168","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255103-d8490168-r954867548-COMO_The_Treasury-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html"

The bedroom was clean and well appointed, and its worth staying in the one the larger rooms overlooking the cathedral which are full of light and feel spacious. No buffet here; breakfast is freshly cooked to order. There is an indoor pool and a modern gym with a wide range of equipment. The stand out feature of this hotel is the service; the staff are delighted you are staying there and their enthusiasm shines through.","0","","COUPLES","2024-04-30","2024-05-06","2024-05-05","en","COMO The Treasury","8490168","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255103-d8490168-r949692254-COMO_The_Treasury-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html"

The building is historic and the service s exemplary. There is a lot of care which is just beautiful to experience. The balcony room was spacious and the balcony was large. The room is beautifully appointed with a very comfortable bed and high quality linens, a good desk and breakfast nook. The bathroom is very large and has a large bath and shower and double basins. 
The gym and pool were quality facilities and I experienced a good massage.
We enjoyed a special dinner at Wildflower but found Post a little noisy and the breakfasts were underwhelming.","0","","COUPLES","2024-04-30","2024-04-19","2024-04-19","en","COMO The Treasury","8490168","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255103-d8490168-r947510175-COMO_The_Treasury-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html"

The room was clean, and even the standard room was spacious and wonderful, and I was glad to stay here from the moment I entered.
The bathroom was a dreamlike space. There was a towel warmer, and the scent of the amenities was soothing, so it was perfect. There were slippers, and there was plenty of space to open the suitcase.
All the drinks were complimentary, and the tea bags were a brand I had never seen before, and they were very delicious. It was very interesting to see that they were promoting Australian products.
We had dinner and breakfast at the post, which was very delicious and had a great atmosphere.
Breakfast was available from 6:30, which was great for Japanese people who get up early in the morning.
I have great memories in Perth.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2b/e7/ba/0e/caption.jpg

Room and bathroom are absolutely spacious, well thought out breakfast nook, gorgeous interiors in cream, lovely beverages in mini bar. Gym is well equipped and the pool is quite haven to come back to, after a day out. Housekeeping and tuen down service is flawless as one would expect in a 5-star establishment.

We used the valet service, which was simply efficient and friendly, equipping us with plenty of bottled water for our car trips. Kudos to the bellboy who was on duty during the Easter weekend, when we stayed. 

As for food, the complimentary breakfast at The Post is delicious. Don’t miss a dinner at Wild Flower, the restaurant at the hotel. 

I can’t actually think of a negative to list. Highly recommend as a great place to stay to be able to explore both downtown Perth and the surrounding locations such as Fremantle and Swan Valley.","0","","FAMILY","2024-03-31","2024-04-15","2024-04-15","en","COMO The Treasury","8490168","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255103-d8490168-r946802640-COMO_The_Treasury-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html"

The room was huge as was the bathroom. Lots of amenities, such as robes and slippers and toiletries.  But there was no armchair or comfortable settee to sit on.  The 2 cane backed chairs at the small table were very uncomfortable as were the 2 chairs on the balcony.  We did ask for another chair and they were full so had none but brought us an office chair (not so comfy either).  My husband does not like reading in bed or watching tv in bed.   And we were there for a week.  BTW, we spent 3 months in Australia and this was our only hotel/inn/apt, which did not have a good chair in the room.

To their credit, we returned for 2 nights a week later and  booked a lower grade room with no balcony.   They upgraded us (and what an upgrade)   the room was even larger and there were 2 armchairs and a couch! They said they ""heard"" our complaint and wanted us to feel comfortable this time around.  This was most appreciated!

The service was on point and they always tried to accommodate us.  

The hotel is situated in a great place - walkable to Elizabeth Quay and the trains, ferries etc.  They really don't have a restaurant but access to 3-4 of them located in the same building.   There is a pool (good for laps or just hanging out) with comfy lounges and plenty of towels.","0","","COUPLES","2024-03-31","2024-04-06","2024-04-06","en","COMO The Treasury","8490168","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255103-d8490168-r945570330-COMO_The_Treasury-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html"

We spent 4 days at this beautiful hotel and could only give it perfection in every way. It is small enough, beautiful rooms, great service, and an amazing breakfast to be acknowledged as the “best” in Perth..if the best in all of Australia.

This hotel is situated in a lovely area downtown where everything is conveniently within walking distance.  There are tons of restaurants, shops, gorgeous buildings all within a short distance of each other. 

We love this hotel, and the staff were amazing. Did I mention the croissants at breakfast? Gigantic and delicious.","0","","COUPLES","2023-04-30","2024-03-30","2024-03-30","en","COMO The Treasury","8490168","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255103-d8490168-r944513815-COMO_The_Treasury-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html"
