Golf course view + pool view rooms are better. Beds are a bit high but on request they remove the top layer & thereafter beds are comfortable. Pool, Steam & sauna are beautiful. Japanese restaurant serves  outstanding food. Staff is extremely warm & courteous. Sapna & Abdul at front office were very responsive to all our needs. Debashish at gym was very helpful. Chef Rajesh Pandagare went out of his way to meet food requirements of a 3-year old to a 90 year old in our family. His veg clear soup, varan Bhatt, paneer butter masala, fruit gateau are to die for. Restaurant manager Debtanu was on his feet during all our meals to serve whatever my family needed.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/fd/63/f0/caption.jpg","FAMILY","2024-11-30","2024-11-02","2024-11-02","en","The Ritz-Carlton, Pune","17620462","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297654-d17620462-r978404645-The_Ritz_Carlton_Pune-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html"

Starting from early check in, arranging tours in the city, facilitating our needs with the best concierge staff.
In addition to amazing food done by the chefs where they have made us a perfect tally based on our request.
The spa is another world, the rooms were specious and well equipped with all what a guest might need.
I will definitely visit Pune just to stay in Ritz and enjoy the hotel.","0","","FRIENDS","2024-10-31","2024-10-22","2024-10-22","en","The Ritz-Carlton, Pune","17620462","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297654-d17620462-r974914129-The_Ritz_Carlton_Pune-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html"
