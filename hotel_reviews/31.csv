From the moment we arrived, everything about our stay exceeded expectations, and there’s simply not one aspect I can fault about this exceptional hotel. The combination of world-class facilities, luxurious ambiance, and the unparalleled service of the staff made our vacation magical and memorable.

Every single staff member went out of their way to ensure our experience was perfect. Their attention to detail and genuine hospitality created an atmosphere where we felt valued and well taken care of throughout our stay. Nothing was too much trouble, and they consistently went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. The level of service we received here is the gold standard, and I would confidently recommend the resort to anyone. In fact, I’m already looking forward to planning our next visit!

A standout highlight of our stay was the dining experience. Chef Kevin deserves a special mention. He was incredibly accommodating, happy to tailor-make any dish to our preferences, and consistently delivered food that was simply divine. His creativity and dedication to flavor made each meal a delight, and the freshness of the ingredients was evident in every bite. Beyond that, the restaurant staff, including Diksha, Naro, Puji, and Dharmendra, were exceptional. Their service was impeccable, always delivered with genuine warmth and grace. They not only made our meals seamless but also added a personal touch, engaging in friendly conversations that made us feel right at home. Their hospitality is something we will always remember fondly.

Another charming aspect of the resort was the delightful surprise of the rabbits that roam the beautifully manicured grounds, lovingly looked after by Hari. Watching these rabbits added a playful and calming element to our walks around the property, making the atmosphere even more special and serene. Hari’s care and dedication to the animals were truly heartwarming.

The overall property is breathtaking. From its pristine pool area to lush tropical gardens, everything is designed to offer guests a true paradise experience. The rooms were impeccably clean, spacious, and adorned with elegant decor that reflected the culture and essence of Goa. Whether it was enjoying a peaceful morning by the beach or relaxing in the luxurious spa, every corner of the resort offered a new way to unwind and feel pampered.

Lastly, the front desk and reception staff were phenomenal, always cheerful, ready to assist, and quick to answer any questions. Their efficiency made check-in and check-out smooth and stress-free, and they made sure we felt welcomed from beginning to end.

The St. Regis Resort in Goa stands out as one of the best resorts I have ever had the pleasure of visiting. We’ve traveled to many places around the world, but nothing compares to the level of care and service we experienced here. This resort is more than just a beautiful place to stay; it’s an experience filled with heartwarming hospitality and luxurious comfort that lingers long after you leave. I can’t wait to return!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2e/04/5b/66/caption.jpg

The staff is incredible, kind, helpful and truly wishing you to have the best time. I felt like a queen and will surely return again!

We booked St. Regis suite room and it was wonderful!

The breakfast and dinner at Miri restaurant was very extensive. Chef Santosh Kumar was very happy to accommodate all of our demands for our 5 days stay at the hotel from making khichadi for 6 month old baby to making home made style subji for my father.

Serving person at Miri restaurant Mr. Ninad Pol was on his toe to serve us so well that he deserves 5 stars

Overall stay was outstanding! I highly recommend St. Regis Goa and you will surely see a different Goa than what you have seen before.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/f3/f8/8f/caption.jpg","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","en","The St. Regis Goa Resort","481825","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g775971-d481825-r978126631-The_St_Regis_Goa_Resort-Cavelossim_South_Goa_District_Goa.html"

Our 15 Day stay at St Regis again this year has been phenomenal. The property is beautifully maintained & upgraded. The resort had so many things for us to do. My daughter enjoyed her bicycle rides, exploring the spice garden, feeding the rabbits and geese.

It so homely because of the entire team, beginning with the front desk to the men and lady gardeners who made everything so green and clean. We saw Kingfishers, pond herons, rabbits and so many birds.

It is a Beautiful vast property, amazing for having long walks and clean beaches. We have been coming here since the past decade, every time having a wonderful experience.

 Our Daughter loved all the activities planned by Joshna and the team at the play area. The library had a lovely mix of Indian and foreign authors; books for kids and us, they are all over at the reception, at Manor & kids play area.

On the beach the facilities are very nice. Every evening, we loved the Champagne opening Ritual (especially my dad) led by the Butler team followed by watching the sunset at Susegado and live music. We thank Abhishek & team.
Charan set us up with a fun-filled dolphin ride.

We enjoyed the breakfast and dinner spread at Miri. The staff led by Chef Santosh, Chef Saumya, Chef Kevin had a delicious spread and cater to every need by my family and our daughter. Thank you to Deep, Sona, Manish, Puii, Mang & Elizabeth.

 Thank you to Chef Santosh and Shanker. We loved the seafood prepared by them. It was just as per their instructions. My daughter built such a lovely rapport with both. They are very understanding.
It was nice that the old team members remember us personally during every holiday we visit. Truly appreciate their gesture.

For a day or two there was a heavy down-pour. Buggy driver Patil & Laundry staff Pravin went out of their way to make our time easy & comfortable.

We had booked 3 rooms with 2 Suites. All were properly manicured to perfection by the housekeeping team. We were happy with the turn down team, as in the evening after we are back from the beach, our daughter brings sand and shells everywhere. The team does not leave any sand behind and neatly arranges the shells on the coffee table.

At the Manor, we loved the High tea sessions with the spread of snacks and cocktails. I would just request that the high tea menu is changed on a routine basis. Umanand entertained us with stories about the property and we could share our old memories of our frequent holidays during Leela days. Divyesh, Akriti and the entire chef team at Manor - thank you for fulfilling my daughters’ wishes.
We loved the experience of having quick bites at the Food truck by the pool. Kheya and Manjit entertained us.

Lastly, I cannot finish without a BiG Thank you to Jonathan, Deblina & Charan who went Above and Beyond to accommodate us with everything that we needed and made our long stay as comfortable as possible. Each and every request was dealt swiftly and resolved.
It was a Pleasure to once again spend time with Satish, Amit & Apoorv. Your staff made our stay memorable.

We are looking forward to our next family holidays at the St Regis Goa.","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-30","2024-10-30","en","The St. Regis Goa Resort","481825","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g775971-d481825-r977333650-The_St_Regis_Goa_Resort-Cavelossim_South_Goa_District_Goa.html"

Many hotel managers  in the “western” world should visit to learn from this property. The location is stunning the grounds immaculate and yes mistakes were made by staff during our stay but what sets the hotel apart is their desire to go the extra mile to rectify the few blemishes. A must stay hotel.","1","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-30","2024-10-29","en","The St. Regis Goa Resort","481825","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g775971-d481825-r977190432-The_St_Regis_Goa_Resort-Cavelossim_South_Goa_District_Goa.html"

I had seen the You Tube videos of its leela days, and aboslutely abhored the dated decor! But once I came to know that this property has been taken over by Marriott & that too under the St Regis umbrella, I did some research and booked their newly renovated deluxe room. And I was vindicated by the wonderful new decor of the room, classy, subtle and mild on senses. Excellent shower, bath tub and service. Comfy mattress and a feeling of being in world class service of Marriott.
When we reached here on Sunday, the brunch was in progress and we joined in. It was fabulous! The spread was amazing. And the everything was delicious. The best restaurant is MIRI and the staff here is just outstanding. The breakfast was sumtuous everyday! The host that I really liked was Naro. She is so welcoming! Always smiling and never imposing. Shubhodeep @ their beachside restaurant was amazing as well. He listened so patiently to what we suggested and then arranged a fabulous Tiger Prawn in butter garlic sauce for me, and a special on demand chicken chettinad with Goan rice for my wife. Both of us felt extremely pleased. Manish @ MIRI was another extremely pleasant young man, with great customer service capabilities. All in all, the staff @ this very well managed property is top notch!
Now some important points! The property is still being renovated, and they do it phase wise, without any noise. So it will take some time for whole property to be ready. Just take any of the newly renovated rooms and You will be OK. The Riverside restaurant is a let down! Its a hall converted to a restaurant and there is no feeling being in a proper fancy restaurant, the decor needs to change here bigtime. The shower, changing facilities @ the pool are abysmal.
In conclusion, I usually visit South Goa once or twice a Year, and everytime we stay @ Taj Exotica. This was the first time we came here & it was just because of the St Regis takeover. And I am certain we will be back here many more times. The wonderful beach, the confluence of the river & ocean, the riverside view, the excellent rooms, the wonderful staff @ MIRI and the fact that this is already a very well managed property will keep bringing us back!","1","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-24","2024-10-23","en","The St. Regis Goa Resort","481825","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g775971-d481825-r976406699-The_St_Regis_Goa_Resort-Cavelossim_South_Goa_District_Goa.html"

Must Must Must Try!!","Had the best times at the St Regis, we stayed at the Manor pool suite and it was beyond beautiful with such fresh view overlooking our private pool.

Our personal butler Abhijith was the sweetest, he managed and nailed our daughter’s sixth month half birthday & made it soooooo special with such details. Kudos to him

Our experience overall was excellent , it felt nothing less than Maldives.

Hygiene was great
Food was superb
Beverages were superb

We loved you St Regis, we can’t wait to be back with our daughter all grown to create more memories !!
