Im used to have very good experience at Pullman hotels but this one is far from Pullman standard. Far from any 5* hotel standard also.
Very old, noisy, poor service and poor comfort.

The singers sing very well, listening to the song at night and drinking very chill. Every employee on the island will meet with a greeting, with a full smile on the face, making people happy. Thank you for their enthusiastic service, hopefully we will soon meet 👍👍 also wish them good and happy.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/eb/d2/bf/caption.jpg

The airport checked in quickly, with children at a separate counter. On the bus, the guide gave him water, that's about it. Yes, the hotel itself looks respectable, a large room, with a large bed, there fit three. When they arrived at 5:00 p.m., the dining room was closed, they said it would open at 7:00 p.m. We could arrange some sort of ala buffet for the guests. They tried to find out where the restaurants were, but at the reception only nothing was explained and had to look for themselves. Eventually they found a pizza place, where a small pizza cost 2500 r. The food is just terrible, no you will not starve to death, but everything is monotonous, after 4 days the children demanded meat, went to restaurants, but the prices here are not small, by comparison fruit (3 peaches, 3 mandarins, a pack of grapes, strawberries and mangoes) cost 4000 r. Let's go on, from the pool and the sea the guards kick out (exactly kicks out) at 1800, by the pool lounge is just terrible, not even music, but just drum bass, is not possible there, to requests to change music neither the bartender nor the manager responds, around the hotel there is construction, dust, dirt, noise. And the cherry on the cake, I had it all on, although I don't drink alcohol, but took it as a convenience so the kids could have any soft drinks. And so at the end of the vacation, I met the fellow countrymen, decided to buy a beer, took a can, just one, and handed it to a comrade, the bartender ran up, ripped out and threw the can on the ground, and I was forbidden to go near the bar. It's like I paid the money and I can't exercise my right, because I didn't get a case of beer and other alcohol and sabotage there. So Turkey is much better, and we don't have that in Krasnodar Krai. I'll try Dubai next time and if that's what it is, we'll cross the Emirates, but this hotel is not like five stars, there's not even two stars to put up for. LES Art Resort 4* in Dorohovo, near Moscow, with 4 stars is much better.","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-26","2024-10-26","en","Pullman Resort Al Marjan Island","4508739","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298063-d4508739-r976736235-Pullman_Resort_Al_Marjan_Island-Ras_Al_Khaimah_Emirate_of_Ras_Al_Khaimah.html"
