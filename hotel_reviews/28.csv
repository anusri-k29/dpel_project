perfectly and uniquely located at the south western coral lagoon tip in a national park by an old volcano.
The GM Mr „Sade” Kaya together with his team takes great care of their guests, and definitely recognize Bonvoy card holders. Guests Relations Manager Ms. „Neha” takes care of your every wish (even if sometimes seemingly impossible) - what ever it may be - works class massage…great dinner…cool park trip…mega Kite surfing nearby…exciting volcano climb…dolphin watching and snorkeling… rum distillery tour…Champagne Sabrage….drivers…coco nuts….room service….activities for kids ….advice & opinion…and much more….

The restaurants are really nice especially the excellent Indian gourmet Indiya (fantastic authentic Divali set menu) and Japanese with sushi, sashimi, and best Teppanyaki food and show by chef from Nepal. Iconic beach, pools, gym with top trainers…

For the Globtrotters among you - this destination is like a nice mix of Thailand, Bali and the Maldives. Definetly worth the trip (& returns) … for a great beach holiday with a lot of cool activities to go with it, in the best luxury setting!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/fc/e2/ea/caption.jpg

It was exceptional.
One of the best luxury hotels on the island.
The restaurant is superb with 5 different restaurants, perfect service. 
The beach access suite is just exceptional 

The staff is super attentive under the direction of Benoit who impels an ultra luxurious but not slick service, which remains simple and close, as we like in Mauritius

We are excited and will return without hesitation next time

A big thank you to the whole team whether on the beach, in restaurants or at the pool.

We were all 4 conquered (both our boys 6 and 8 included)

See you soon!

The location in Le Morne on the beach overlooking the striking mountain is a dream and the staff do everything to make life as pleasant as possible. Especially the food in the various restaurants was amazing. Here our thanks go especially to the Boathouse team with excellent Greek, Turkish food. Thanks especially to Rao for the great service. 
Since our flight was only booked for late at night on the last day, we were allowed to use our room all day thanks to the possibility of a late check-out. 
There are certainly also some small things to complain about, such as some old-fashioned furniture in the room or sometimes longer waiting time for coffee at breakfast, but all in all you get really excellent service here for your money. Thanks again to the German-speaking concierge Daniel who helped us with all our concerns.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/f6/e0/3a/caption.jpg

The luxurious accommodations, stunning ocean views, and impeccable service set this resort apart.

A special shoutout to Rikish, who took care of us at the beach. He anticipated our every need, from refreshing drinks to beach towels, and his warm hospitality truly enhanced our stay. The attention to detail and the beautiful surroundings made for a perfect getaway. We can't wait to return! Me and my mom highly recommend you this hotel!

I must say that at first glance I found myself a little disoriented because the journey is long and fatigue at my age is felt more. 
When I arrived at the airport in Mauritius, Luxemauritius' assistant waited for me with a huge welcome sign in my name and a garland of flowers; I cried with emotion. 
I am a lover of reading, predilection for classic novels and in this paradise I found my dimension with a huge library of which you can see the photo.
Despite my high blood sugar, I could not resist a quantity of dessert with an indescribable taste. The resort boasts an exceptional in-house pastry shop!
As for the sea, despite not being very good at taking pictures, here is what my eyes saw. 
I must say that it was all very nice despite the loneliness was felt more than at home.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/ed/d1/b6/caption.jpg

We love everything about this hotel, its setting in the foothills of Le Morne Mountain, the mile long beach, the huge pool, the range of complimentary water sports, the excellent food and wide range of dining options, but what makes the resort so incredible is the friendly and amazingly helpful staff. From arrival to check-out the quality of service is exceptional. We had a small issue at the start, which the General Manager dealt with real professionalism and good client service. It is hard to highlight particular individuals, but we love Aroumel (Pool and Boathouse), Yash (Beach and pool bar) Wilkims (our amazing butler) l, Khun Khun (Porter and Front Desk), Jayram, Shyram, Charlotte our lovely waiters and waitresses at Le Manoir, Bria our lovely waitress at the Boathouse, Veresh, Vince the Deputy GM who was exceptional, as was the General Manager who took care of our every need and chatted to us on several occasions.

It’s surrounded by mountains and see is very calm which is good for kids. Waves are stopped by reef which is 600-700 meters away from the beach. We have experience staying in the top branded hotel on the east side of the island. But we haven’t such positive experience from there. 
Best location and personnel imho. Special thanks to Neha, she met us on the first day and provided us best service during our stay. 

Planning to go back there for December 2024 kids holidays.","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-28","2024-10-28","en","JW Marriott Mauritius Resort","2655689","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g488105-d2655689-r976958339-JW_Marriott_Mauritius_Resort-Le_Morne.html"

We spent 8 nights at this resort and just enjoyed it.
The hotel gave us a nice junior suite , which was very close to the beach as well as close to a small pool. That was just great that you could already take a dip in the sea in the morning before breakfast. The junior suite was very spacious and left nothing to be desired.
The complex is overall very extensive and also has the most beautiful stretch of beach in Le Morne. The view of Le Morne from the beach is incomparable. For joggers, there are great opportunities to walk on the beach as the beach stretches for several kilometers. Everything is very private and quiet. Also the large pool area is great, there is a great fitness area and a kids club that is open from morning to night. 
The breakfast was great , rich and varied and left nothing to be desired. We also used each of the restaurants at least once for dinner (Japanese/Thai/Indian/Buffet Mauritius style as well as steaks and seafood on the beach) and we were not disappointed once. Great food and also priced perfectly fine. We especially loved the teppanyaki at the Japanese restaurant.
The spa was great too, so my wife and I booked 90-minute massages twice each, which were great. Price-wise, the massages for a 5-star hotel were completely within reach.
Overall, the hotel is very generous. The water - even in the restaurants - is always free, there are always free snacks on the beach and there are many activities offered free of charge such as kayaking, snorkeling, etc.
Since we celebrated our wedding anniversary during our stay , the hotel offered 2 bottles of champagne, a delicious cake and canapés to the room during our stay. Very thoughtful. 
However, we would like to emphasize the friendliness of all employees. All were top motivated and very warm (to our daughter also very child-loving). We can't mention them all by name now, but we would like to thank Daniel (excellent guest attendant), our butler Bavish , who took care of everything very attentively and warmly, as well as our super waiters Tarvin and Rap, who always took care of our daughter very fondly. 
Overall a great hotel! We will come back!","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-28","2024-10-28","en","JW Marriott Mauritius Resort","2655689","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g488105-d2655689-r976950453-JW_Marriott_Mauritius_Resort-Le_Morne.html"
