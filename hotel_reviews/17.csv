The metro station 'Financial Centre' is a 2 minute walk away and 1 stop down the line is the Burj and the mall. Taxis are available 24/7 should you wish to navigate a different way. It's only 15 mins from the airport (traffic dependent) 

The rooms were very spacious with plenty of storage. The beds were big and we got a a great view of the city. 

We only had breakfast in the hotel but there was plenty to choose from. Eggs station, fruit, pastries, cereals etc. 

Hotel staff were friendly and overall I would highly recommend this hotel due to the price and location","0","","FAMILY","2024-11-30","2024-11-05","2024-11-04","en","Towers Rotana","306762","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d306762-r978751017-Towers_Rotana-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

Front reception staff very pleasant and helpful with directions around this beautiful city. Close to the largest shopping mall in the world and the tallest building the Burj Khalifa which we took the super fast lift up to the 125th floor. Also exceptional breakfast buffet at the hotel. Great location and cheap to get around by taxi or train.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-11-03","2024-11-02","en","Towers Rotana","306762","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d306762-r978468565-Towers_Rotana-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

The hotel rooms are of a good size, were clean and quiet.  The breakfast was very good.  There are taxis regularly outside the front of the hotel.  We didn't eat a meal at the hotel but noted there is a good range of restaurants.","1","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-11-02","2024-11-02","en","Towers Rotana","306762","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d306762-r978389004-Towers_Rotana-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

Bilal took us to Abu Dhabi and city tour he was so well informed and at the end of both tours we were so much informed. Salma kept on checking on how our experiences/tours went and helped by going out of her way to ensure we were relaxed, the pressure was released as she had everything organised for our tours. I strongly recommend Towers Rotana was definitely worth our stay.","0","","NONE","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","en","Towers Rotana","306762","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d306762-r978137724-Towers_Rotana-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

Salma, Abdala, Bilal our Wonderful tour guide ♥️","Wonderful experience. Dubai story should not be told. It should be experienced in person. The Towers Rotana staff were Wonderful. We checked in late due to a missed flight, and Abdalla kindly allowed a late check out. ❤️ ❤️ Dubai

The reception by concierge at the door, very receptive and helpful. Shahid, you're a gem. When our friend missed the dhow cruise pick up, you arranged for an alternative thank you.

Our tour guide Bilal was helpful, a very safe driver and presented the history really well. Very Jovial and showed us around beautifully during tour of Dubai, and trip to Abu Dhabi.

Thanks to Salma for organising the activities. Our schedule was packed and you found us activities that packed out itinerary.

We will come back ❤️","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/f4/1a/bb/caption.jpg","FRIENDS","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","en","Towers Rotana","306762","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d306762-r978130284-Towers_Rotana-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

And while the hotel is not new, the impressions of staff care and cleanliness at the hotel override that. There was one unpleasant nuance - the hotel was under renovation, very loud and visible from morning to evening.
