The room was very clean luxurious and spacious   with a dining table and a living area in addition to  an  en suite bathroom and high end amenities. the balcony is very spacious with a stunning view . 

I had communicated with the hotel team a few days prior to our check in  namely Ms with Ms Loretta from the Guest relations who made sure that all birthday decorations were in the room and we were very pleasantly surprised to see the room very nicely decorated not to mention the birthday cake . 

the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful yet very professional and well trained . 
special thanks to Ms Afun Devi from the reception who actually took the time to write a personal birthday note to my wife which was a very nice touch !!

Room service was spot on and never delayed and not to mention the birthday pancake that was also provided to us during breakfast .

the final parting goodwill gesture was by Mr Asad from reception who gave us a late checkout till 4 pm .

we had a wonderful time at the hotel and highly recommend it to any one looking for a  relaxing break and especially those wishing to celebrate any special occasion as you will be pleasantly surprised 

finally i would like to thank the whole Mandarin oriental team for making this special occasion an unforgettable memory !!","0","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-09-30","2024-09-29","en","Mandarin Oriental Jumeira, Dubai","15244079","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d15244079-r971951927-Mandarin_Oriental_Jumeira_Dubai-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

You want to come back and you want to recommend to everyone !!!! We visited Jumeirah al Naseem, Jumeirah at Sadiaytt, The Address, Caesar Palace, Emirates Palace, Atlantis The Palm and Royal Atlantis, comparing all these hotels safely can say Mandarin Oriental , you guys are the BEST !!!!!!! Huge room , cleaning on the day of arrival we had three times , always perfectly cleaned room, whenever you go there, you will always have everything perfectly laid out and tucked in and cleaned , you will be bookmarked in the book, you will not be bothered if you are in the room, chic mattress, huge bed ,pastel linen, pillows , blankets, towels , renovation everything is chic , the most exquisite and varied breakfasts in the UAE and on the menu and in the buffet , the waiter as in Moscow does not leave you , your glass is constantly replenished with water, if you drink just water, exotic fruit always in huge abundance and berries, perfectly cleaned fruit , freshest, was even a cherry first seen it in a hotel in the UAE, I want to say that such care and attention as you will be surrounded in Mandarin , you will remember for life !!! If you need the best service and the best vacation, then you in Mandarin, if you need luxury and vip, then you here )))) Waiters, guys serving us from Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, one named Ali, the name of the other did not remember unfortunately, and all the staff of the restaurant huge hello and our gratitude and respect !!!  Our acquaintances, visiting Mandarin said that there is a Mandarin and all other hotels, we totally and absolutely agree, we used to say so about the Four Seasons, but having visited you, can safely say Mandarin in our list is now number 1!!!! Service on the beach, if you need shade, beech fights will make shade for you, moving umbrella and sunbed, always ask how you are doing, find out what to help and if we are happy with everything, we have changed towels because they are wet and in the sand, you will be cooled from a spray gun, if you wish to cool down, you will be offered cold sorbet, ice and cold water, Oleg on the beach, you are the BEST,thank you so much for your care. You have made our beach holiday unforgettable and the single best beach holiday of all the hotels we have been to, remember you warmly in the shower!!! Always absolutely everywhere in all areas of the hotel you are welcome and all absolutely staff try to provide you with the best service , you will be opened the door when you walk from the beach to the hotel, smile and say that they are very happy to see you and welcome back!!! At the moment we moved to Royal Atlantis, in terms of service and power , it was not even near Mandarin. Now about the downsides the hotel is bald, but it was written about in all the reviews, nothing changed, we were ready for it, what a beautiful Caesar Palace , what a green it enjoys and admires every beautiful plant there, here Mandarin very loses, you want more greenery and plants by the beach, an eye small area , it is practically non-existent, also dinners on the menu at Caesar Palace much tastier, and that the most unpleasant thing twice in the 5 days of our stay along the whole coast was a dirty brown strip in the sea , which was practically half a day (very unpleasant and uncomfortable swimming in such a sea( Photo of the sea attached. We go to the sea and for the sea , there are seaweeds on the shore , they are not taken from the sea by day (Well after the sea on Sadiyatt hardly anywhere else can like the sea , but we knew where we were going and generally tell you before new meetings beautiful Mandarin, you really VIP","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/93/5f/04/caption.jpg
