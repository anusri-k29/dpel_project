We were upgraded to a Villa with private pool by the team and are extremely grateful for their service. I’d like to extend a special thank you to Natasha who enabled us to have a late checkout and dinner on our last day. All the staff were extremely attentive to all the small details from allergies, decorations and even remembering small touches we appreciated from the night before.

We really recommend this hotel to any couple that wants to have a memorable stay and feel completely at home all while being catered for with perfect service.

Thank you once again to all the team we will definitely come back for another visit.","0","","NONE","2024-10-31","2024-11-03","2024-11-03","en","The Oberoi Beach Resort, Mauritius","302546","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g488101-d302546-r978479982-The_Oberoi_Beach_Resort_Mauritius-Balaclava.html"

We spent 5 nights here as a family of 3 and could not have been any more happy.
The staff were attentive and helpful without being intrusive, the room was amazing and the food was simply fantastic. The menus were full of variety and changed mid week so you had another amazing array of dishes - all perfectly formed.
Plenty to do within and around the resort - the hotel arranged for a beach horse ride for my daughter which was a great experience. Nothing was too much for the Oberoi team!
It was our first time at an Oberoi and we will definitely go back again.
Thank you to all the team - you made our time in Mauritius so special.","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-29","2024-10-28","en","The Oberoi Beach Resort, Mauritius","302546","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g488101-d302546-r977068440-The_Oberoi_Beach_Resort_Mauritius-Balaclava.html"

From the moment we arrived, when we were immediately taken to our room where we checked in until the moment we deported, we were treated like honoured family guests. All the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, the food fantastic in all restaurants and our room was extremely comfortable and serviced to an incredible standard every day. It is a truly great hotel and amongst the best in the world.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-29","2024-10-28","en","The Oberoi Beach Resort, Mauritius","302546","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g488101-d302546-r977061546-The_Oberoi_Beach_Resort_Mauritius-Balaclava.html"
