a warm reunion with Mrs. Nocula, this time at the reception and Mrs. Hahn and the cook (unfortunately name not present) made us feel at home at breakfast.

From the moment we checked in until the day of our departure, I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of service and attention to detail. I appreciate how V (Assistant Front Office Manager) assisted us with our check out issue. The staff  demonstrated unparalleled hospitality. Each team member I encountered was not only professional but also incredibly friendly and attentive. Their warm welcomes and eagerness to assist with any inquiries truly made me feel valued as a guest. Truly an Iconic property.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2b/0a/cf/89/caption.jpg","FAMILY","2023-12-31","2023-12-18","2023-12-17","en","Steigenberger Icon Frankfurter Hof","202275","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d202275-r930128117-Steigenberger_Icon_Frankfurter_Hof-Frankfurt_Hesse.html"

The hotel is a classic , very good conference room and their cuisine was superb. Their rooms need an update though. What affected me most is the head concierge ; Holger Alexander Muller. He was the best I’ve ever encountered in a hotel ( I travelled to nearly 60 counties so far ) It was very obvious he liked his job. He gave lots of tips about the city and always cheerful, immaculately dressed  as well. 
Just round  the  corner of the hotel there is Goethe’s house, do not miss it!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/f7/80/f3/caption.jpg

We were required to be escorted to our rooms each time we needed access which was very inconvenient. There was a line of people waiting to be escorted and obviously insufficient staff to escort patrons in a timely manner. 

The room itself was very nice. View was decent. Breakfast was also decent","0","","COUPLES","2024-08-31","2024-10-01","2024-10-01","en","Steigenberger Icon Frankfurter Hof","202275","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d202275-r972204526-Steigenberger_Icon_Frankfurter_Hof-Frankfurt_Hesse.html"

There is nothing to complain about the kindness of the staff, on the contrary. Always trying and accommodating.
The room and especially the bathroom is really fantastic, even if the one or the other repair (defective bed lamp) would be necessary, it simply exudes a special cosiness. The air conditioning went well and was also urgently needed on the days. 
The bar is simply classic good, you should definitely make a detour. However, where there is definitely potential, breakfast would be. This was 2017 when we were already on site significantly better, more extensive and with more finesse. Now it's just standard.","0","","BUSINESS","2024-06-30","2024-09-26","2024-09-26","en","Steigenberger Icon Frankfurter Hof","202275","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d202275-r971440708-Steigenberger_Icon_Frankfurter_Hof-Frankfurt_Hesse.html"

I slept years ago here in lovely clean and airy room in a room with light interior.
This time got a room with a double door (you can hear the neighbours breathing at night). Luckily I had ear plugs.
Upon arrival was a bit shocked of the old fashioned romm in dark brown (furniture, cushions, carpet etc), which smelled old and mouldy. Slept with an open window all night.
Bed was comfortable, bed linen nice and crisp.
Checkout was strange, only thing I was asked was, if I want to use the provided credit card. No question about the stay, the room etc. Not very welcoming.
Not to repeat, which is a shame, as it is perfectly located. But not worth the money for what you get.","1","","BUSINESS","2024-09-30","2024-09-17","2024-09-16","en","Steigenberger Icon Frankfurter Hof","202275","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d202275-r970084832-Steigenberger_Icon_Frankfurter_Hof-Frankfurt_Hesse.html"

What a gorgeous hotel right in the best area to be when visiting Frankfurt! Old town is a 10 minute walk away, and is a bustling area that we loved!  Our room was beautiful, nice large windows that open, living area with desk, mini bar, beautiful bathroom and soft bed and linens. my only issue with the room was we had a view of the roof and a wall.....management happily agreed to a room change, but my husband and I agreed the room was so nice, we'll just stay. Breakfast buffet was elegant and plentiful. The service was FABULOUS! The staff here goes out of their way to make sure you have everything you need. Frankfurt is very walkable and we were able to walk to markets to get water, fruit, etc. for the room. The hotel booked a day trip via a Mini bus for us to Rothenburg which is a MUST if you go to Frankfurt! The town is amazing and dates back to the 1200s!","0","","COUPLES","2024-08-31","2024-08-28","2024-08-28","en","Steigenberger Icon Frankfurter Hof","202275","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d202275-r967224896-Steigenberger_Icon_Frankfurter_Hof-Frankfurt_Hesse.html"

The hotel is conveniently located. 

We arrived prior to check in so room was not ready, it took a while for this to occur post check in time.

Our room was very comfortable and well equipped with Nespresso machine and water replaced daily, and a TV with English news channels, the bed was very comfortable and the room had a comfy armchair (just one!) too.  The bathroom would have benefitted from a walk in shower, but that’s a common problem. We had a lot of problems with the safe, and were given a deposit box at reception until it was fixed. Breakfast buffet was very good, with fresh eggs to order. During the summer the signature bar is shut so drinks are served on the terrace instead. There’s a very good spa and sauna area. The hotel itself is within walking distance of key sights like the cathedral, Goethe house and Paulskirche, as well as lots of good restaurants. A good place to stay at the heart of Frankfurt.","0","","COUPLES","2024-08-31","2024-08-26","2024-08-26","en","Steigenberger Icon Frankfurter Hof","202275","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d202275-r966829544-Steigenberger_Icon_Frankfurter_Hof-Frankfurt_Hesse.html"
