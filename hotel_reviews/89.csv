Room was lovely, clean and had a lovely view of the park behind hotel. We had a door to next door in our room which we heard the neighbors laughing and taking before bed and early morning. Not their fault as they were not loud, but a warning to do not get an interconnecting room if you don't need one. All needs met, had robe, slippers, iron,  board, hair dryer, shampoos, soap, shower cap, sewing set, tv and remote (only German language tv I could find) bed was so comfy I slept like a baby. When we checked in our room was not ready but we were given free drinks to help accommodate us which was refreshing after a long travel day. The breakfast was delicious. Had cereals, fruit, meats, breads and pastries, cooked eggs and bacon, fresh juices and different teas and coffees. and it was all cooked brilliantly and tasted amazing. Staff were super efficient. Underground station right outside and main station is a 10 minute walk.  Taxis right outside if needed

Lift squeals and is clunky. I was put in a room right by the lift shaft on the 4th floor. I tried to ignore it but it constant fog horn sound. Not as loud but unavoidable and you hear everything being loaded on the bottom floor. They need to insulate rooms or lift or lift shaft. Asked to be moved, came to 
room with key and it was a far greater number so assumed away from lift. They just put me the other side of it.  It’s not our job as guests to deal with this, it’s the hotels","0","","BUSINESS","2024-06-30","2024-06-15","2024-06-15","en","Sheraton Essen Hotel","234191","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187375-d234191-r955176452-Sheraton_Essen_Hotel-Essen_North_Rhine_Westphalia.html"

With the name of this hotel, you expect a high-class hotel (especially for the price)

We were kindly received and helped at the reception and after checking in we immediately took the suitcases out of the car which was in the parking garage underneath the hotel.
It remains special that you have to pay to park at a hotel.
Especially with the current hotel prices, this should be free and does not feel hospitable.

The room was nice and big (but there was no place to put the suitcase, so we had to put it on the floor.

In these modern times you expect to be able to connect a laptop, Chrome cast or whatever to a TV, but it was so tightly controlled with their own system that nothing was possible.
If only the TV channels were still international, but very many German with a single English channel.

On day 1 at breakfast (which is possible until 11:00 on weekends), there was no one at the entrance on the first day and waitresses were almost running to clear the tables.
When you walk in at 10:00 you expect that the bread baskets will still be kept full, but this was not immediately the case.

Day 2 was even stranger.
We walked on again because there was no one standing there, but a waitress almost ran towards us, pressed a sheet of paper with a pen into our hand and shouted something to fill in the blank.
My name, room and signature had to be put on this. We don't know the reason for this yet.
But even stranger and not as it should be, the sheet of paper was placed on the desk but no one immediately took it away and so a name and signature were up for grabs!
And now again 2 small special rolls and only when we were about to get up to walk away did some new croissants appear.

All in all, no more than an expensive average hotel, which I did not expect from a hotel with this name.","0","","COUPLES","2023-09-30","2023-09-07","2023-09-07","en","Sheraton Essen Hotel","234191","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187375-d234191-r915331421-Sheraton_Essen_Hotel-Essen_North_Rhine_Westphalia.html"

The staff was noticeably friendly and competent. I had a room on the upper floor with a view of the park, very, very nice. Unfortunately the room didn't smell so good, I think it was from the carpet, I've experienced this again and again in similar hotels, strange that they can't get it under control. The breakfast was very good. Parking for €13 in the underground car park is also fine. I would come back again and again.","0","","BUSINESS","2023-08-31","2023-08-22","2023-08-22","en","Sheraton Essen Hotel","234191","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187375-d234191-r912242180-Sheraton_Essen_Hotel-Essen_North_Rhine_Westphalia.html"

Das Zimmer (Suite) war in Ordnung aber auch nicht mehr so ganz frisch. Das Bad wurde bereits erneuert. Der Reinigungszustand war ausreichend. Die Deckenlampe war bestimmt schon 1/2 Jahr nicht mehr geputzt worden. Das Bett war sehr aber sehr bequem, im hinter dem Hotel liegenden Park war es sehr laut, so dass ich nachts nicht lüften konnte. Das Frühstück war in Ordnung. Alles in allem hat aber das Preis Leistungsverhältnis nicht gepasst.  Eine Wallbox sucht man auch vergebens, auch das ist leider nicht mehr zeitgemäß. Schade... Anregung: Zimmerrenovierung in Angriff nehmen, Garage mit Wallboxen ausstatten.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/29/af/36/9a/caption.jpg

Das Personal ist sehr freundlich, die Eingangshalle modern gestaltet.
Unser Zimmer was das Bad sehr schön neu renoviert, das Schlafzimmer aber etwas altmodisch aus den 80ziger Jahren. Der Teppich wirkte schon recht benutz, das Bett etwas altmodisch, die Kühlschranktür klemmte.
Das Frühstück ist wirklich Top, ehr 5 Sterne mit großer Auswahl, Eierspeisen können auch frisch bestellt werden. Lachs, Roastbeef, Käse, Wurst, leckeres Obst, Müsli, Sekt, etc., nur keinen frisch gepressten Orangensaft.
Insgesamt waren wir sehr zufrieden, wird im Zimmer etwas modernere Einrichtung wünscht sollte die modernisierten Zimmer bestellen.

Efficace mais très peu souriant. 
Ambiance vieillotte dans cet hôtel. 
Propreté RAS. 
Chambres bien équipées avec bonne literie mais il serait bon de mettre tout cela au goût du jour. 
Petit déjeuner complet avec de bons produits. Par contre, nous y sommes descendus à 09:00 et cela semblait être le moment « coup de chaud » pour un dimanche matin. C’était très bordélique, les tables mettaient du temps à être refaites. Bref, une véritable désorganisation que j’ai rarement vue dans ce genre de structure … il faudrait réorganiser tout cela ! 
J’allais oublier un point important. Le lounge étant fermé, nous avons dîné au restaurant. Aieeeeee !!!  Tout est à revoir ou presque. L’entrée unique était nulle, le dessert idem. Par contre, la sauce façon bolognaise accompagnant les pâtes était excellente. 
Donc, pour moi, si je résume,  les chambres sont propres et bien équipées (si ce n’est que dans une chambre pour deux il faut mettre Deux peignoirs et non un seul …). Le bas blesse pour la restauration.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/26/da/cd/fd/caption.jpg

They still navigate in that ""corona-excuses-cloud"" trying to use that for every shortcoming. Lots of discussions with staff about basic no-brainer items. Not worth listing them all here as the overall experience is just annoying. Sheraton in Germany needs to get their act back together fast - that business model is likely not going to fly for long by just hiring interns, juniors and trainees (out of which some do not understand  only basic German, English, Spanish, French, Italian) and asking the customer to pay a premium for such poor service. One good thing to point out: the Lounge happy hour that got moved to their Restaurant (as the Lounge is closed - Corona). Getting the building back up to speed, small refurbishment needed, and appointing a minimal level of trained staff would give a different picture.","1","","NONE","2022-08-31","2022-08-16","2022-08-16","en","Sheraton Essen Hotel","234191","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187375-d234191-r854428024-Sheraton_Essen_Hotel-Essen_North_Rhine_Westphalia.html"
