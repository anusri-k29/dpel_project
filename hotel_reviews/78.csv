Strategically located near the airport is a highlight, it is a boon for transit passengers. The elegant atmosphere and meticulous cleanliness require a mention and the service is  impeccable and polite.

Check in is quick and the executives at the front desk Kunika Thakur, Bhumika, Nishtha Khurana, Atul Gera and others are always ready to help.

The rooms are Immaculately clean and hygienic, and full compliments to the Housing staff.

JW cafe is wonderful and the Team of Kunal Sharma, Om, Shoaib, Momi Das, Rutik,and the chefs Rohit Satvi, Nilesh Telang and others make it a delightful experience with the large Delicious Spread laid out. Concern for the Environment is evident with a Green Plant on every Table.

The Lounge on the 17th Floor has its own story. With an awesome view of the Airport and the City, the staff at the Lounge Balphi, Shahbaaz, chef Roy, Laasya, and others, Patil, Rutik, Nishant, Rupali Kumar, Priti Chatterjee offer impeccable service with a smile and make the experience memorable. 

Saamreen and Nisha at Guest Relations are always providing help and make the guests comfortable with their innovative ideas.

Check out is quick and The Experience is Unforgettable and one of the best","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2e/07/f4/68/caption.jpg

While traveling with an infant, you always seek for more and that is what JW Marriott fulfilled.

Specifically I would like to mention about my breakfast experience in Restaurant. Nitesh Telang personally met with few guests to c heck their experience and feedback. There was another lady who was also kind enough to come and seek feedback on the quality and range of breakfast items. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, food and service.

While areas in central Mumbai and Bandra are typically favored, it’s hard to ignore the JW Marriott in Andheri, next to the international airport. The experience from the time you enter the hotel through the expansive rooms and incredibly attentive service made my stay very memorable. Without exception, I will be a return customer. A special thanks to Chef Naik who made the stay “over the top”.","0","","BUSINESS","2024-10-31","2024-10-25","2024-10-25","en","JW Marriott Mumbai Sahar","7621418","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d7621418-r976646791-JW_Marriott_Mumbai_Sahar-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html"

But recent experiences have been horrible. Took two rooms from 18/10/2024 to 20/10/2024. 
Went for dinner at JW Cafe at 8pm. Food was good but terrible service. Had to literally clear the table ourselves since no one was responding. Messed up the orders. Beers were lukewarm. After even complaint they did not pay heed to our complaints. Next day the F&B manager did approach and offered a free dinner but I told him freebies is not what I’m looking for just want to keep coming back and have good experiences here as I love the hotel. Had to ultimately leave mid course after paying the bill. It’s was horrible. 

Checked out at 10:30 and forgot my used clothes in the room. Was in the hotel till 4pm having brunch and just lounging but during the whole time no one from the hotel calls up informing us that you have forgotten something in the hotel. On reaching back home I realise o forgot stuff at the hotel and contact them.Ms Marcella assures she will help but does not call. Again on calling them the housekeeper tells me that it’s company policy to not inform the guest about stuff they have forgotten. Guest have to remember and call the hotel in a limited period or they discard it. Weird policy. It take half a minute to call up the guest and inform them that you have forgotten your valuables. 
Then I speak to the duty manager Mr. Darshit but he gives the same reply but an added dash of Attitude. 
I was in the hotel and could have very well collected the stuff if the hotel would have been kind enough to just give me quick call but they say it does not sit well with company policy. 
So basically a horrible place to stay and eat too. And worst is dealing with the executives there who thave forgotten the concept of service.","0","","BUSINESS","2024-10-31","2024-10-21","2024-10-20","en","JW Marriott Mumbai Sahar","7621418","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d7621418-r974748749-JW_Marriott_Mumbai_Sahar-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html"
