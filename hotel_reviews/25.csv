The hotel was lovely beyond words.  Rooms were very clean and well appointed.  I use a wheelchair, and the hotel assisted me in renting one for the entire stay. The entire staff was wonderful, and the doorman Pasqual was the best; highly recommend The Rubens at the Palace.","0","","FRIENDS","2024-10-31","2024-11-04","2024-11-04","en","The Rubens At The Palace","199868","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d199868-r978688026-The_Rubens_At_The_Palace-London_England.html"

Everyone was amazing but in partIcular, we must mention Rosie the concierge who looked after us so well,  Saif the Restaurant Manager who is excellent at his job in running the English Grill and his cooking, and also Raj and his team who aided us from the Taxi when we arrived and saw us off again when we left.
Impeccable, relaxed, friendly and helpful service throughout made it a very enjoyable and relaxing visit. 
Well done everyone - we will be back","2","","COUPLES","2023-07-31","2023-07-24","2023-07-24","en","The Rubens At The Palace","199868","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d199868-r905208055-The_Rubens_At_The_Palace-London_England.html"

Every detail was meticulously attended to. Upon learning that we were attending a theatre performance, the staff not only remembered but surprised us with a beautifully themed cake based on the show when we returned to our room. The staff were exceptionally courteous, professional, and friendly. Coupled with a location right next to Buckingham Palace, it's an undeniable 5-star experience from us.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/f4/23/38/caption.jpg","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","en","The Rubens At The Palace","199868","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d199868-r978130731-The_Rubens_At_The_Palace-London_England.html"

We'd like to acknowledge Raj, doorman Pascal, Artemois (sic), the other doorman Sam(?) and the bartender Stanley. They were helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable about issues/items we had. The bedroom was fine, except I forgot that the UK uses different terms on the bedsize; next time asking for a King. The location of the hotel, near Victoria Station, really helped my wife get her bearings as this was her first trip to Eurpe. This location allowed us to jump off to various sites around London. It had conveniant pubs nearby where we got to revist with my cousins. Overall, a terrific vist and excellent stay at the Rubens. Finally, I'd like to thank Mick who was in management and had a very informative discussion with me about this hotel and others in the portfolio of the hotels managed and owned. We would definitely stay here again.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-26","2024-10-26","en","The Rubens At The Palace","199868","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d199868-r976731142-The_Rubens_At_The_Palace-London_England.html"
