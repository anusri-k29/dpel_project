Not my passport or even the card I used to book the reservation. When I questioned the hotel about this later, they said it was because I prepaid for the hotel. It’s not reassuring to know that anyone could’ve been given my reservation and access to my room that I already paid for. In addition, my partner and I were handling four luggages, and we weren’t even offered help up to our room.

The room was not impressive at all. The queen bed was uncomfortable, and I could hear all the street noise from outside. In addition, the rug was old and the linens were rough. There were scuffs on the wall, and the sink was scratched up. This definitely wasn’t what I was expecting from a so-called luxury hotel.

On the second day of my stay, my partner was feeling sick, and we asked the hotel if there was a spot to heat up some of our food. It took twenty minutes for the front desk to answer their phone, and they told us we could heat up our food on the thirteenth floor. When we got to that floor, we were questioned what kind of food we were heating up. The workers were disdained that we wanted to heat up Filipino food. They said we couldn’t heat up our food there due to regulations, but they could give us plates and cutlery to eat with. We gladly accepted and started eating our leftovers in the dining area.

Another worker then came over to us and yelled that we couldn’t eat in that space and we had to take the food back to our room. I asked if we could take the desserts that were given out as part of their free chocolate hour back to the room with us and I was met with a resounding no. I understand there are certain regulations, but there’s no need to be rude about it. When I brought my complaints up to the deputy manager, he said that I only had these complaints because I’m American. My nationality has nothing to do with me expecting cordial and respectful service.

Housekeeping was also slow, but Elli provided great turnover service. That and the location are the only good things about this hotel. Save your sanity and book a room at the Four Points by Sheraton in Auckland. They provide exemplary service and secure accommodations.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-29","2024-10-29","en","Mövenpick Hotel Auckland","257792","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255106-d257792-r977162970-Movenpick_Hotel_Auckland-Auckland_Central_North_Island.html"

It is fantastically located Downtown Auckland so position wise it is extraordinarily great. Rooms clean, comfy beds and pillows front desk attentive and service-minded. Dining room experience was however an utter letdown. Staff running, lack of attention to details not responding well on issue with food (we were very discrete) snotty at afternoon chocolate hour etc let our otherwise excellent stay in Auckland somewhat down. Would we stay again not sure about that.","0","","FRIENDS","2024-10-31","2024-10-10","2024-10-10","en","Mövenpick Hotel Auckland","257792","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255106-d257792-r973307685-Movenpick_Hotel_Auckland-Auckland_Central_North_Island.html"

We were travelling for my birthday, and staff were incredibly attentive. The Boda restaurant on the top floor is top notch, and seems to also be quite popular among locals. 

Rooms are stylish and comfortable and super quiet.

Chocolate hour is a fun treat, which we used as our wet weather plan. It conveniently leads into happy hour!

Lastly, it's location right next to Britomart station, the Ferry Terminal and the main shopping street makes for a super convenient location. 

Couldn't recommend this place more highly!","0","","NONE","2024-09-30","2024-09-20","2024-09-19","en","Mövenpick Hotel Auckland","257792","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255106-d257792-r970514684-Movenpick_Hotel_Auckland-Auckland_Central_North_Island.html"

We had a city side room which could be a bit noisy at times but not too bad, double glazing one day might be worth considering. The room was very clean and well serviced, staff very friendly and polite. The location is fantastic, walking distance to just about everywhere. One thing we did notice was the lack of information in the rooms, most motels/hotels have a folder with information explaining what services are available in the hotel and some info about local cafe's restaurants etc. We didnt know there were laundry facilities and found out about the chocolate hour by reading a note written on a mirror in the hallway. If ever in Auckland again we would stay again and would recommend the Movenpick to anyone travelling to Auckland.","0","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-09-18","2024-09-17","en","Mövenpick Hotel Auckland","257792","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255106-d257792-r970234448-Movenpick_Hotel_Auckland-Auckland_Central_North_Island.html"

The room had a small fridge, coffee machine and the standard amenities were available in the bathroom. 

Breakfast is served on the top level and is standard of a hotel buffet breakfast, however, The view of the water is spectacular. There are plenty of other places around the property that serve great coffee and breakfast options that you can also try. 

The property is close to public transport, Commercial Bay and Britomart and is walking distance to Viaduct. 

My first stay at a Movenpick property was an enjoyable one.","0","","BUSINESS","2024-09-30","2024-09-08","2024-09-08","en","Mövenpick Hotel Auckland","257792","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255106-d257792-r968906947-Movenpick_Hotel_Auckland-Auckland_Central_North_Island.html"

I Recommendation both for the location and for the cleanliness and attention to the customer. Excellent and very large breakfast, enjoys a beautiful room on the 13th floor not to be missed. Unfortunately we missed the highly recommended chocolate hour.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/33/e7/da/caption.jpg
