Het hotel goede faciliteiten zoals een eenvoudig zwembad en een prima gym. De uitstraling is hier en daar wat verouderd en het is vrij commercieel. De kamers zijn ruim en de bedden zijn goed.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2e/08/69/d2/caption.jpg

We were originally on the 2nd floor and this corner suite has more living space, and the bathroom has a double sink, shower over bath and a separate room for the toilet
We were moved after the first night to the 6th floor and this corner suite has slightly less living space due to the layout, and only one sink in the bathroom but a separate bath and shower, with toiletries
(info may be helpful depending on your needs as the rooms were different in layout and amenities)
We had an issue with the bed in the first room, this was kindly resolved by the manager Fabian by moving us to the 6th floor (as the technician was unable to fix it and to also allow them time to replace the bed in the 2nd floor room for other guests)
We have stayed at this hotel several times and never had any concerns, the bed was broken on this occasion but the staff would have been unaware of this issue unless they happened to be sleeping in the bed!
Fabian was very kind and courteous, and the issue resolved satisfactorily and promptly
The rooms were clean, and well furnished and the breakfast selection more than ample
We ate in the restaurant in the lobby on one occasion and the meal was good, with pleasant staff throughout the hotel
We would recommend this hotel, and had a great stay
For general info the Gendarmenmarkt area outside the domes opposite is undergoing construction until 2024, this did not impact on our stay (other than the view) in either noise levels or access  to the hotel/ surrounding areas at all
The location is great with lots of attractions, restaurants and shops in the immediate area, and only a 20 to 25 minute pleasant walk to the Alexanderplatz area","0","","NONE","2023-08-31","2023-08-12","2023-08-12","en","Hilton Berlin","191438","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d191438-r909802431-Hilton_Berlin-Berlin.html"

A vast complex with restaurants, bars and leisure club is ideal for a stay in Berlin. Staff are really helpful and friendly although I found the concierge could have been more help.
Unfortunately I am giving this hotel a poor rating due to the state of my room.
On arriving in the room on day one I found it dirty, with a layer of dust over all surfaces. It was obvious these hadn't been cleaned for a while. I wrote ""Clean me"" with my fingers on 3 different surfaces. During my stay my room was serviced, yet on day 4 the writing was still there.
Hotel management need to do a serious review of housekeeping as staff rush through servicing and don't make a decent job. 
If it wasn't for this I'd have given a high score.

A warm welcome on arrival and a sumptuous and spacious family room, with a little teepee for the kids to play in. 
A really comfortable night’s sleep and the most plentiful breakfast to start the day with everything you could possible wish for and all of the highest quality!
Our stay was made even more special by the excellent service we received from Nassim at breakfast time. Nothing was too much trouble and he is a real credit to the Hilton. Thank you all!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/f7/9e/eb/caption.jpg

The credit cards were taken from my hotel room and taken out of my wallet. I didn’t leave them in the breakfast area or the lobby. They were in my room! The kind of privacy violation that, most likely, someone from the hotel personnel put me through is not something to be expected from a hotel like Hilton. Funny enough… the credit card I left as my deposit card when checking in was left inside the wallet, not stolen. Makes me wonder…

I am very disappointed with the service and support received from all the staff. The empathy, service, and customer support were basically nonexistent. Zero follow-up or proposing any type of support after the incident. 

Filed the report with the police and, of course, with the hotel.","0","","BUSINESS","2024-10-31","2024-10-30","2024-10-30","en","Hilton Berlin","191438","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d191438-r977440219-Hilton_Berlin-Berlin.html"

The breakfast was amazing , the location could not be better access to every were you want to walk , taxi, Uber , . Was very impressed. The only thing I can say , is the rooms and even hallways have to be updated , looks a little worn , the bathroom tub was difficult climbing in and out .

Our room was spotless and had an amazing view of the cathedral—what a way to wake up! 

A special shoutout to Leonida in the Executive Lounge. She was so kind and attentive, always making sure we had everything we needed. Her warmth really added to our experience, and we loved her dedication from her time in breakfast service too.

Overall, we had a fantastic time and can’t wait to come back! Thank you to everyone for making our stay so special!","1","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-18","2024-10-18","en","Hilton Berlin","191438","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d191438-r974422959-Hilton_Berlin-Berlin.html"

And who could blame us:  1615’ of luxury over 2 levels, with an easy-to-climb carpeted staircase… a full bathroom with separate shower… not 1 but 2 guest toilets (one on each floor)… an enclosed kitchen area with 2-burners, microwave, larger refrigerator, illy espresso maker and kettle… your own private sauna, which feels terrific after you work out on your own private Peloton bike… a massive sitting/view room with giant couch and matching giant TV overlooking the Gendarmenmarkt as well as 3 of Berlin’s most impressive buildings — the German Cathedral, the French Cathedral and the Konzerthaus.  You may find yourself unwilling to leave this palatial suite, but Berlin beckons as you will see from one of the many, many windows (that tilt-open).  The Fitness Room on Floor 1 is 24/7 although early-birds before 7 am will need to take a different elevator (well marked, by Room 6063).  Here, you will find 3 benches, free weights, mats and an array of exercise machines.  Also on Floor 1 is the breakfast buffet restaurant (6:30 weekdays, 7 weekends) — and bring your appetite because it’s all here, including some delicious made-to-order omelettes.  The Executive Lounge on the Lobby floor opens at 6 all mornings to get an early coffee or fruit and pastries.   And the bar/restaurant area also off the Lobby is overwhelmingly beautiful and so peaceful.  Our 5-day stay in hotel paradise began when we were checked in by Daria, who is not only lovely but highly efficient too as we found out when we needed her to straighten out a billing issue (on our part, not the hotel’s).  A very special “Danke!” to GM Markus, who more than 6 months before our arrival helped us decide on just this very fabulous suite that belongs on your Wish List as well.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-16","2024-10-15","en","Hilton Berlin","191438","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d191438-r974099400-Hilton_Berlin-Berlin.html"
