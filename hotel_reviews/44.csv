Charm and challenges of an older property no different from our experiences with El Tovar main suite and Bucky ONeil Suite, Grand Canyon and Zion National Park Lodge ...i.e. location on prime National Park ""real estate"" for active and nature minded individuals.   

If it helps, expect quirky imperfections along with the privilege of enjoying national treasures.   In this visit, so thankful a quieter Classic Cottage in a duplex setting was available for our gear sorting and healthy ""eats"", cooler with lots of water and hydrating options we shopped for in Fresno.   Bathroom and side storage area buffer from unit on back side.   Room was clean, all needed features working...used the small heater (similar quirky heating workaround to our Bucky ONeil Cabin in Grand Canyon years earlier)...shower water hot...pressure, low flow conservation fixture. 

All staff were attentive, helpful and friendly during our encounters when we needed assistance.  We generally like our privacy and independence and requested no contact for housekeeping...we booked for location and ambiance vs. pampering ...extra supplies provided upon request with short explanation from us, no questions asked...tp, extra towels, coffee etc....Note:  coffee machine was not a regular Nespresso machine but thinner single serve expresso like caffeine hits.   worked for us...we left the other type we brought from Fresno for housekeeping to pass along or trash.

Classic cottage was delayed about an hour as final inspection and placement of a concierge collaborative bottle of chilled wine was placed with glasses pre arrival..  

After 16.85 mile 4 mile, Panorama to John Muir ""walk about"" with side explorations...next day...broke down and enjoyed the buffet breakfast to replace calories and experience the ""dining room""...Meal warm, views beautiful, staff thoughtful, smiling and attentive.   Iconic window seating...thank you who ever allowed the cap wearing tired old dude peaceful table location to enjoy the ""historic dining room experience"" with his better half of many years...buffet choices warm, varied and actually preferred as no waiting around.   Industrial makeshift trailers housing kitchen crews and equipment outside some windows was expected.   

Forced valet situation was never an issue we thought might hamper our ""get n go"" plans.  Guys and one gal all friendly, literally fast and always helpful with our questions they have probably answered many times before us.   Tips are shared by Valet team, Bell help is individual.   Tips never expected, service on point with our expectations...thanks to check out day Valet who turned the rental seat heat on.   Who knew the joys of heated seats on cold mornings....smile.  Really appreciated the small extra stuff given the hustle and bustle at the stand...
 
Prices:  imagine being a supplier, employee or contractor having to drive the winding roads for crazy beautiful Yosemite valley access and surroundings...yes, prices are high but not different from other similar like properties nestled in the middle of national treasures.    

So grateful the hotel and staff attempt to make the best of a tough (but needed) construction situation so future couples, families, etc....can enjoy the property for many years to come.....","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2e/04/65/10/caption.jpg

Our room view was great. I was worried after reading some of the reviews, but I think people need to remember this is an old hotel and old doesn’t equal dirty.

The hotel is majestic, historic, and aged just like we like it to be, and we would stay there again. However, the hotel management needs to heed the areas of improvement needed as mentioned in many of these recent reviews. 

Dining in the great room is a treat but due to the construction and shut down of the kitchen only buffet dining is available. The buffet is basically the same every night and really below average even for a buffet and at $66 per plate, overpriced as well. Service and seating are limited because of “short staffing” but it’s a buffet? Why not do a BBQ or bring in gourmet food trucks as alternatives. Why is the bar on short hours and no small bites available there? 

Every cottage we were in had the split system AC inoperative and replaced with floor portable AC that don’t have sufficient capacity, and heat in the cottage was a small electric heater thus we were hot then cold. Wi-Fi in cottages does not work well at all. Room was not serviced as the staff was “really busy”. You get exactly one towel and one coffee pellet per person if your room is serviced at all.

It is hard to justify the value for the price; maybe wait until construction is fully completed before you stay.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-27","2024-10-27","en","The Ahwahnee","119543","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g61000-d119543-r976840416-The_Ahwahnee-Yosemite_National_Park_California.html"

I have stayed in many hotels and I realize cleaning and turning over a hotel room is hard work. However, usually management ensures the rooms are inspected before they are given to the next guest. I do not know what management is thinking but our room was dirty, dusty, and had a pathetic wisp of a blanket cover. Accountability is on management, maybe there is not enough help or staff are not effectively trained. Gosh, even the carpet was horrible with visible stains. The bathroom tub did not drain, and the air permeated with camp-fire smoke either due to someone building a fire right outside or just poor ventilation. I was surprised the smoke alarms did not go off. The treat was for a high-priced room located in the magical valley of Yosemite. The Yosemite Valley was magical but the Ahwahnee was not the hotel experience I had hoped for. I would not mind the construction, the subpar food, or the smoke however any room, small or large, budget or premium, the BASIC expectation is a clean room.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/e8/7d/7c/caption.jpg","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-26","2024-10-26","en","The Ahwahnee","119543","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g61000-d119543-r976750294-The_Ahwahnee-Yosemite_National_Park_California.html"

My husband and I stayed for 2 nights at the Ahwahnee Hotel. Prior to arriving we had read the poor reviews online and were prepared the hotel wasn’t going to be in its highest state of glory. However, the most disappointing part was the service. 
Firstly, we arrived after a long day of driving at 4:30pm to find our room still wasn’t available- despite check in being at 4pm. The hotel couldn’t give any estimate on when it would be ready either and didn’t seem remotely sorry just said to come back later. Even some sort of apology would have gone a long way as this was our first impression of the hotel. 
On finally making it to our room, the reviews are indeed correct about the state of the rooms- but again we were at least prepared for this. 
The really issue came on our second day at the hotel where we left early on a full day hike at 7am and returned at 5:30pm. On returning to our cabin/ cottage we found not just one but BOTH doors to our cabin to be completely wide open. Anyone that accesses the property would have been able to see our doors completely open and have full access to our room!! Including access to wallets with credit cards and money, jewellery and passports!!! Given the notoriety of the hotel and that we were the first cabin located off from the main hotel building we were very concerned by the extreme breach of safety and security!! 
We immediately went to the main desk to explain our severe dissatisfaction and the manager we spoke to could not have been more rude. She offered absolutely no apology for the situation at all just simply said it was the house keepers first day and that’s all. While we were extremely mad at what had happened some compassion and sympathy would have gone a really long way. After again explaining our disappointment at the extremely overpriced amount of money one pays to stay this hotel to not even be able to provide basics like locking a door while providing a room service was an awfully upsetting end to what was a great day of hiking for us. The manager eventually offered to compensate us with a 20% discount of the room rate for ONE NIGHT ONLY which again did little to make up for the experience. 
Overall, while what happened was extremely concerning and we were lucky that again none of our belongings were stolen what was the most disappointing was the lack of care or compassion from management about our situation. We again saw the manager on check out and she again offered no apology to us. After checkout again I sent a follow up email to express my disappointment and have not received any communication from the hotel- so it’s clear that the hotel simply does not care for any feedback whatsoever. If you wish to have all of your personal belongings accessible to be stolen from entire public walking through the hotel and have no compassion from the staff or care whatsoever then please stay at this hotel. But we will never return. It unfortunately ruined our time in Yosemite and we left with very un fond memories.","1","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-16","2024-10-16","en","The Ahwahnee","119543","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g61000-d119543-r974176411-The_Ahwahnee-Yosemite_National_Park_California.html"

In full transparency, the gift shop was the was the only impressive aspect of this once beautiful hotel aside from its excellent location. 

The gift shop had a great selection of high quality, embroiled apparel and local artisan pieces of artwork/pottery on display. An excellent selection of merchandise and friendly staff (in there only).

In walking around the common areas of the hotel lobby I first was in awe of the grand scale and craftsmanship of the main great room. There was a musty, stuffy smell throughout the hotel that felt as if there was zero ventilation occurring. The closer I started to look around the sadder I got seeing the peeling paint on the water damaged ceiling, filthy worn out furniture, finishes worn off of every surface, this is a very neglected sad state of affairs. 

The water station was empty and looked dilapidated. People were in a line at a reservation both to make an in person reservation? Very outdated way to book a reservation. A man got out of an elevator and had to open a cage door, something I haven't seen in years nor is it safe by today's standards. 

I went online to check out the prices thinking this is probably a $300 a night property (being a bit high just for the location) but my jaw nearly dropped when I saw the $900 a night rate. Absolute highway robbery. Fortunately we were staying at Rush Creek Lodge for half the price and 10x the amenities in a much cleaner, better serviced hotel a short drive from the park.  

Hopefully this once beautiful hotel gets the attention it needs to bring it back to its glory. The place has insane potential to be an absolutely exceptional property. Current management seems to be lettering the place deteriorate by deferring the extensive, long overdue basic maintenance for now in addition to cost cutting wherever possible. Unfortunately it is glaring to even passing through guests so I can't imagine what it must be like to stay here.","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-14","2024-10-14","en","The Ahwahnee","119543","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g61000-d119543-r973956096-The_Ahwahnee-Yosemite_National_Park_California.html"

You really can not beat the location, how easy it is to access nearby attractions/traild and THE VIEWS. However, it’s as clean and well maintained as they can be, based on its location and age so expectations need to be adjusted. There’s century’s worth of history and dirt ground in the carpets and the tiles are worn and chipped in the small bathrooms but where else can you fall asleep to waterfalls right outside your balcony?

We also found the staff and all the workers in the parks to be such wonderful people and genuinely happy to be there.","2","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/c0/a5/c3/caption.jpg

I wasn't even sure the room was ready so I went back to the front desk and asked for another room, I was told that's not possible, and someone would come to the room to clean it up.  So the cleaning cloth and the sweeper disappeared magically after I returned to the room. This is not what I expected for the price tag.  The price is definitely not justified for the service level.","3","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/bb/15/39/caption.jpg

The only practical reason to go to The Ahwahnee is to bask in the ambiance of the public spaces -  the Great Lounge and its side rooms, the dining room, and the grounds between the hotel and the river.  Hold that thought.

On this visit, our first $700 ""Classic View"" room overlooked the exhaust fans on the kitchen roof and a bunch of construction trailers.  After repeated pleas and griping to the front desk and the manager, we were transferred to a larger room with a filtered valley view which was satisfactory.  The rooms have a classic decor but are not fancy.

Aramark had warned us repeatedly about the ongoing construction and its impact on meal service so we had only one meal in the dining room.  This was a $30 per person  buffet breakfast with a decent array of food choices but many of the hot items were not, in fact, hot.  Service was excellent, attentive but not overbearing.  I think the servers were glad to see somebody, anybody, in the restaurant.  It was far from crowded even with the the relaxation of the dress code which meant baseball caps (not removed)  and flip flops were acceptable fashion.

We had drinks in the bar but no ""light bites"" were available as described in the list of hotel amenities because of some problem inspectors had found in the kitchen.

There were private, noisy events in the Under Lounge and Solarium both nights we were there so there was no relaxing in the Great Lounge experience. 

Why stay there if visitors can enjoy the public spaces and dining experience?  Because only by STAYING there can you feel like you BELONG there.  That's the heart of The Ahwanhee's value proposition.","1","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-10-06","2024-10-06","en","The Ahwahnee","119543","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g61000-d119543-r972858206-The_Ahwahnee-Yosemite_National_Park_California.html"
