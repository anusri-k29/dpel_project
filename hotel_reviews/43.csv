On peut presque toucher la Tour Eiffel !!! 😀
Très bon petit déjeuner ! Salé, sucré, orange pressé,
Chambre un peu vieillotte mais on oublie vite avec la vue et la proximité de la Tour Eiffel, départ des bateaux mouches, etc…
Après, un mot sur le responsable de la réception, uniquement là pour satisfaire totalement ses hôtes, quel professionnalisme !!! Bravo Hotman, et encore une fois merci pour votre très grande gentillesse et bienveillance !","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2e/04/b0/db/caption.jpg","FAMILY","2024-11-30","2024-11-04","2024-11-04","fr","Pullman Paris Eiffel Tower","197985","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d197985-r978691813-Pullman_Paris_Eiffel_Tower-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

As a business traveler, I specifically asked the hotel staff if all charges—including breakfast and room service—could be included on a single invoice for reimbursement purposes. They assured me this was possible. However, when I checked out, I discovered that these charges had already been processed separately by credit card and could not be added to the main invoice. The hotel staff claimed they didn’t have access to the restaurant charges, which was both unexpected and unacceptable. For business travelers who need comprehensive billing for expenses, this is a serious issue. While the hotel may be adequate for tourists, I would not recommend it for business stays due to their inability to consolidate charges properly. This experience was frustrating and potentially against standard hotel practices.","0","","BUSINESS","2024-11-30","2024-11-03","2024-11-03","en","Pullman Paris Eiffel Tower","197985","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d197985-r978560533-Pullman_Paris_Eiffel_Tower-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

Accustomed to hotels in the Accor group, we wanted to test the Pullman next to Mercury where we have stayed before. Arrived around 3:30 pm, the room was not yet ready, we were allowed a drink at the hotel bar to wait. 16h15 arrival in room, we discover the very nice place with the beautiful unobstructed view of the Eiffel Tower on the 10th floor. Little disappointment because I had specified by email and during the booking that it was for a specific stay to celebrate our 8 years of marriage and the receptionist at the reception had indicated us a particular attention in room and nothing was done (no upgrade, no special attention ...) pity. Regarding room 1037, noted problem of very low water pressure and no hot water on the rain effect at the top of the shower ceiling, a little average and not so acceptable for an establishment of this standing especially at the price of the hotel night!!! The bedroom has a marked look on the furniture, traces of beating and rubbing on the walls, fortunately the view was there to make up for the inconvenience.   Rooftop closed because privatized for an event of the dassault company, we would have liked to have a drink or dinner to admire the view from the hotel shame... Breakfast the next morning, perfect nothing to say beautiful buffet, hearty and qualitative. The hotel as a whole the common areas are clean, very good smell, the restaurant frame is very nice and qualitative, and the staff as a whole is very caring for guests and very helpful. 

In summary, a little disappointed with our romantic stay because I would have liked to have a privileged moment where special attention during our stay especially as I had specified by email my request. The clientele is 80% foreign in the hotel, we should think to pamper the French a little more to give them the taste and the desire to return more often for me because the hotel is pleasant especially by its location near the Eiffel Tower and the main monuments to visit in Paris...","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/f6/a7/1d/caption.jpg

The staff is so accommodating and helpful from the porter who whisked our luggage away to the front desk staff and concierge. We arrived early, but were allowed to check right in. The lobby was decorated in orchids and pink ribbons for a pink October. People seemed to enjoy their work and made us feel at home and welcome. The breakfast buffet is fabulous, and we also had a very good dinner in the restaurant. There is a rooftop restaurant and bar and views of the spectacular Eiffel Tower which is just steps away. Merci, Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel pour une belle visite.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-28","2024-10-28","en","Pullman Paris Eiffel Tower","197985","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d197985-r977029321-Pullman_Paris_Eiffel_Tower-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

1. I ordered room service, but I came and delivered food without a greeting, and asked if I had to pay for the venue, so I just said so, and after the payment I looked without saying anything. The staff member who brought me breakfast was very friendly, and it seems to be a problem for the staff member. Worried about the room service? A feeling of wanting expression and ignorance.

2. In the morning, I was preparing for breakfast in my room, and the cleaning team opened without a knock. And when I realize there's a person, I immediately close. It's a luxury hotel, and it's not a neighborhood motel, it's an incomprehensible part of just opening doors without any knock. Nearby motels shouldn't do that.

The location is really good but I don't know if it's a service for that price range.
For this price, you can get better service from other hotels.
In other hotels we received better service than this one.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-26","2024-10-26","en","Pullman Paris Eiffel Tower","197985","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d197985-r976681525-Pullman_Paris_Eiffel_Tower-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

Staff was great. Very clean. One complaint is that there are no drawers to unpack. There is a closet with a shelf above and hangars.  My husband and I had to live out of our suitcases.  The bathroom had very little counter space.  The shower consisted of a very deep tub/shower combo which was a little difficult to step in and especially out of. If those things I described wouldn’t bother you, then I would recommend it.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-22","2024-10-22","en","Pullman Paris Eiffel Tower","197985","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d197985-r974992948-Pullman_Paris_Eiffel_Tower-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

We checked into this hotel late at night and were greeted by the nice people at the reception. On our request we were given rooms overlooking the majestic Eiffel Tower. The morning breakfast spread was also good and the servers were there to look after the needs of all the guests . Room service was quick and reasonable priced . We enjoyed a comfortable three day stay at this nice hotel .

We were staying for a couple of nights, so getting a view of the Eiffel Tower was not a priority.  Our room faced the back of the hotel and we had a balcony that faced a lovely garden.  It was quiet which was nice as well.
For a hotel that is located in a major city, we were pleasantly surprised how large our room was.  We felt the breakfast buffet was worth the cost, as there were many choices.
Unfortunately, the bar that has the best view of the city had closed for the season.","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-18","2024-10-18","en","Pullman Paris Eiffel Tower","197985","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d197985-r974455511-Pullman_Paris_Eiffel_Tower-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"
