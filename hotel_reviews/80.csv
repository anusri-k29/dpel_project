I felt so comfortable moving around the hotel as there are people to guide you in every corner. One another point to mention is about house keeping - cannot be better than this, a benchmark!","0","","BUSINESS","2024-11-30","2024-11-04","2024-11-04","en","Conrad Pune","8625588","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297654-d8625588-r978724482-Conrad_Pune-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html"

I stayed here for 7 nights, everyone I came across has been warm, helpful and kind. 

I fell ill on the 2nd night due to travelling. The duty manager Saif was amazing - he got me an on call doctor, collected my prescribed medicine, sent me fruits etc. He then continuously checked up on me to make sure I was okay. This was super kind.

Secondly, Yuvraj has been part of the house keeping team. He ensured the rooms along with outside areas were always in pristine condition. Because he knew I was ill - he gave me extra waters and also checked up on me. I was so impressed with this.

Thank you Conrad - your team is great!","1","","BUSINESS","2024-01-31","2024-01-14","2024-01-14","en","Conrad Pune","8625588","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297654-d8625588-r933999183-Conrad_Pune-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html"

We booked deluxe Interconnecting rooms which was great if you are travelling as a family .  We were given an early check in almost 3 hours before which most hotels rarely give .  Check in staff was very polite and quick . 
Rooms are large and comfortable with huge windows  so there is  ample sunlight.
A  sofa  ,  a ledge by the window , chair and desk provides work space as well as seating.  All fittings are modern with smart switch boards  for lights , AC and curtains . The room was beautifully decorated for my kids birthday which we had come to celebrate.   We ordered room service twice during our stay which was prompt , tasty and well presented. 
We ate a meal at the PSB which was like their coffee shop which was average . The roof top restaurant Aldila is excellent and a must visit .  The poolside eating area however can be improved. The seating looks a bit worn out and they only had one attendant to serve . 
Breakfast even though was crowded being a SUNDAY morning.. was excellent with lots of variety. All the staff go out of their way to make sure you are being served. 
Chetan who attending to guests at the breakfast was very attentive and polite . 
The next morning he presented us with us a plate of pancakes with a Bon voyage message .  He also gave us a box filled with muffins and croissants for our car journey back .  Check out was also smooth and very efficient.  
All in all a well managed hotel with great staff.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2e/04/43/50/caption.jpg

There were beautiful Diwali decorations and live flute music at breakfast. The Indian food is superb with a new special dosa every day.
I also had an excellent haircut in  the salon, given by Surog. He carefully followed my requests and I am very pleased by the result. I hope to come back to this hotel many times in the future.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/fc/32/db/caption.jpg

It's Conrad and only Conrad for me. Right from the moment you enter the hotel to the moment you settle your dues and walk out, you are taken care of in the best possible way. All the staff seem to be at your service, in a very professional and courteous way. 
The breakfast spread is amazing. This time I also indulged myself in spa and i am so glad I opted for it. The massage followed by the steam bath was so relaxing and rejuvenating. 
Thanking each and every one at Conrad for this awesome hospitality always. ","0","","BUSINESS","2024-10-31","2024-10-28","2024-10-27","en","Conrad Pune","8625588","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297654-d8625588-r976917999-Conrad_Pune-Pune_Pune_District_Maharashtra.html"
