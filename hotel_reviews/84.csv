Self service ice, free snacks and drinks in the rooms, comfortable and clean rooms.  Super reception staff who can not do too much with recommendations for places to see etc.  Breakfast is fabulous with an amazing array of fresh  delicious foods.  The staff  in the breakfast room are so friendly.  They even offer cooking classes in the evenings.  Tge situation is fabulous with shops and restaurants all around but quieter than other areas.  A great stay.

The room was spacious for a couple and clean, and well appointed.  We felt the  included breakfast was about the best we'd seen anywhere.  There's an excellent restaurant on the top terrace well worth considering (we stayed three nights, and ate there every night; why discard a bird-in-the-hand?!). This hotel is about a 25 minute walk in evening heat to the Spanish Steps, and about the same to the Pantheon downtown...give or take.  Thirty-five to forty minutes by foot to the Colosseum. Would we recommend to others that they stay at the iQ Roma?  Yes, without any qualms whatsoever.","0","","COUPLES","2024-08-31","2024-10-27","2024-10-27","en","iQ Hotel Roma","1729030","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d1729030-r976900265-IQ_Hotel_Roma-Rome_Lazio.html"

Sleep Quality: 5","Highly Recommend","This is a fantastic hotel. First is the location which is walking distance from the Roma Termini and very close to the colosseum. We walked to all of the main sites except the Vatican. Some of the attractions were further but walkable. Rooms are large and beds are comfortable. The first night we were in a room with a queen bed and sleeper sofa with the latter being very comfortable. Then we switched to a larger room with 2 queen size beds. Both rooms were excellent both in size, storage and comfort. I would highly recommend the cooking class which is given at the hotel. The price includes not only learning how to make the dishes but you are then served the food you've made with wine. There are things you learn with a hands on lesson with a chef which you can not learn from a book or youtube. We loved it. Breakfast at the hotel was extensive and worth the extra cost. The first morning we went to a local cafe and go a delicious muffin but it meant leaving the hotel and standing on line to get it. The breakfast in the hotel is so much more convenient. There were hot foods, bakery items, fruits, cheese, cereal, yogurt, cold and hot drinks. It is card access and the area is very safe. Staff were very friendly and helpful. They gave us maps to get around and suggestions for restaurants.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/e4/fe/9a/caption.jpg

It was even better than 13 years ago.
The hotel has been renovated quite recently
The rooms are super comfortable bedding, pillows. 
It is well soundproofed, everything is very clean.
Daily, a young woman passes for the reassortment of drinks in the mini fridge (free service) 
Kettle with tea and coffee in bags. 
small bottles of shower gel shampoo and Vanity kit in the bathroom with three kinds of towels. 
A lot of services available at this hotel so you can stay there with only one suitcase of 10 kg per person. 
it's a big plus +++
There is a great Jacuzzi open until October on the roof terrace. 
There is also a sauna which we have not tested and which must be booked in advance at the reception. 
Snack and beverage dispensers of all kinds with a very good value for money. You can even find in the dispenser of one floor of toothpaste a razor of brushes et cetera.... 
Ice makers. 
Excellent rooftop restaurant with 10% discount thanks to the hotel. 
You can also wash and dry your laundry (45 min drying in a very efficient honey machine) with tokens for €5. 
All the hotel staff is great:
 very nice, good advice and always there to help. 
Just watch out for pickpockets on crowded public transport (BUS 64). 
Otherwise for those who love hop off buses, the pink bus ""i love Roma"" is fine. 
From 1 alone
Tour of Rome in 1h30
Otherwise 
Don't miss out on the Palatine Colosseum and forum, the extraordinary Vatican museums 
We will definitely come back and stay again in this excellent hotel IQ HOTEL ROMA!","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/e3/7b/3a/caption.jpg

Room was large and spacious and had two single beds for my teenage sons (they hate a room with a sofa bed, too big for it now). Free drinks in mini bar every day was a plus. Air on was quiet so no problems sleeping. 
Hotel was modern and clean, we loved the jacuzzi on the roof top. It wasn’t heated so was such a relief after walking round the city in 39 degrees. 
The breakfast was exceptional, all tasted catered for a very good quality. 
My sons loved the water fountain which dispensed fizzy water as well, great for filling your bottles before you headed out. 
Would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again","0","","FAMILY","2024-07-31","2024-10-10","2024-10-10","en","iQ Hotel Roma","1729030","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d1729030-r973338893-IQ_Hotel_Roma-Rome_Lazio.html"

I did not give it 5 stars because it is not deluxe.
It is in the center but a 15-20 minute walk to
most tourist sites. It is on a quiet street right next door to the opera with many restaurants near by as well as the central station .
Breakfast was unbelievably good. It was quite a spread with choices for everyone.
The hotel has minimalist decor but rooms are nicely done and vey clean .
This was our second stay here.
Security is excellent.
Staff is extremely helpful and easy to deal with.
In the high inflation Rome hotel scene it is reasonable for what you get.
There is a roof garden, hot tub, gym and self service laundry.
The restaurant on the fifth floor is independent but quite delicious.
All snacks and beverages in the minibar are included.
If you are Diabled the shower tub in the bathroom is quite deep and difficult to get in and out of. We did not like it. They may have rooms for disabled guests I do not know.
It’s all you need but not deluxe. There is a Mero stop nearby but we found the metro limited . The hotel can get you a taxi but getting one for the return can be difficult.
