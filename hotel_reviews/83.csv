Breakfast was good, possibly could be bigger variety but did the job. The lady at guest services Marjana was lovely and kindly gifted me with a bottle of wine after a very tiring stressful day, and gave my children goody bags which they loved! Can’t wait to come back and my children won’t stop talking about it! I also left some luggage behind so that was sorted swiftly too! Thank you!

Location is perfect, next to Waterloo and Westminster station. 
Hotel is nice looking.
Some things disappointed me unfortunately :
- the breakfast : you need to pay a supplement if you want any toppings on your scrambled eggs or if you want Benedict eggs or something like this. You also need to pay a supplement if you want pancakes or waffles. I think this is a shame : I have been in many hotels around the world even hotels with less stars and I never saw that especially in hotels that cost this amount. 
- the housekeeping : I have stayed two nights. I agree with the fact that it is not necessary to change the towels but why the room is not clean ? The beds not done ? The garbage emptied ? Coffee or Tea refilled ? No one warn me that there is no housekeeping in this hotel. 

To conclude, you pay the location and only the location. And you pay it way too much. I won’t come back.","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-11-02","2024-11-02","en","Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London","1657415","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d1657415-r978410654-Park_Plaza_Westminster_Bridge_London-London_England.html"

But the room was good with the added bonus of a microwave and fridge.

The air conditioning in the room was not great so the room was a bit stuffy. The also room lacked a few  basic facilities like power sockets near the bed so no phone charging at night!  But was otherwise good. 

Bathroom was well appointed and certainly served the purpose. 

The hotel is in a great location for access to Westminster and key London landmarks!

  It was all generally clean throughout the hotel. 

Staff were friendly and helpful!","0","","SOLO","2024-10-31","2024-11-02","2024-11-02","en","Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London","1657415","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d1657415-r978407468-Park_Plaza_Westminster_Bridge_London-London_England.html"

The hotel is in an excellent location with breathtaking views of Big Ben, the London Eye and the Houses of Parliament. It's a short, safe stroll to the banks of the Thames with it's carnival atmosphere and abundance of things to see and do. It's also close to tube and train stations. The room was spotless, warm and comfortable. The staff were friendly and professional. Couldn't fault it at all. Really looking forward to another visit and trying out more of the hotel's facilities.","0","","FRIENDS","2024-10-31","2024-11-02","2024-11-02","en","Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London","1657415","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d1657415-r978360671-Park_Plaza_Westminster_Bridge_London-London_England.html"

Great hotel, excellent standard. Rooms equipped with many comforts, including a microwave and a power outlet station including the European and US. The only flaw, the lack of coat hangers, both in the bedroom and in the bathroom: there being only one, it is impossible to hang two bathrobes. The rooms (mine was on the tenth floor) are very bright and well soundproofed. Breakfast is varied and quality, but you should not delay, to avoid an annoying queue that involves a rather long wait to access the room. The price, considering the quality offered, the location and the fact that we are in a very expensive city, is definitely honest. I believe that during my next stays in London, I will definitely return to Park Plaza Westminster","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","en","Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London","1657415","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d1657415-r978165376-Park_Plaza_Westminster_Bridge_London-London_England.html"

We stayed in a king family studio very comfortable for our needs. Some areas need attention scuffs around and stains in the sink. Bar service wasn't the best and the queue for breakfast huge, although it did move at a reasonable pace. Housekeeping had to be requested which was frustrating considering the price. We would stay again","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","en","Park Plaza Westminster Bridge London","1657415","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d1657415-r978126703-Park_Plaza_Westminster_Bridge_London-London_England.html"
