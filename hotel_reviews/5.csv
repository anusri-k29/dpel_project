Lovely swimming pool/spa area. Sauna, steam room, and jacuzzi are open till 10 pm which is helpful for those who return late after their meetings. 
I can’t say the location is good. It’s near the airport but rather far from historical landmarks and market areas. During rush hours, the fastest way to get to the centre is the metro; Bhikat Cama Metro Station is right next to the hotel","0","","BUSINESS","2024-10-31","2024-10-26","2024-10-25","en","Hyatt Regency Delhi","306931","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304551-d306931-r976657360-Hyatt_Regency_Delhi-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html"
