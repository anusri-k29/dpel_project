Hotel vicino al centro, una passeggiata di 10 minuti, 6 piscine a Cascata una dentro l'altra, diversi ristoranti, camere molto grandi. Colazione ottima, super e variegata. Personale gentile, cortese e disponibili, prezzo onesto per essere un Hilton e per il ponte di Ognissanti.
Piccoli nei che non mi fanno mettere la quinta  stella, un pò freddine le camere e la piscina interna fredda, non è riscaldata, come comunicato anche dal bagnino.  
In ogni caso ci tornerei.

Great pools and easy walk to the main square. Take a stroll through the on site orange grove. You can and should taxi to the smaller fishing village to dine and walk back.","0","","NONE","2023-11-30","2023-11-26","2023-11-25","en","Hilton Sorrento Palace","231243","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187782-d231243-r927440296-Hilton_Sorrento_Palace-Sorrento_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html"

Camere ampie e pulite, dotate di tutti i comfort.
Ristoranti e sale comuni veramente belle.
Funzionale anche il teatro interno e le piscine (una interna ed una esterna).
Sicuramente una struttura di livello alto.

Brilliant hotel - perfect for hosting the event as had great size rooms for meeting rooms/presentations and large theatre style.  They put great lunches on in the gardens catering for over 500 people. We also had a brilliant gala dinner set up in the breakfast room with pre drinks round the pool. 

Despite being here with “work” I could totally appreciate this hotel from a “leisure” view. Great location with views over sorrento (this does however mean it’s up hill)
NOTE there is another entrance half way up the hill so don’t need to walk to main door. 

Great outdoor bar area. Also roof top pool/bar (however as out of season this was only open in the evening)

Breakfast was great - lovely view too!

Would definitely come back with family.

We are a well off couple in our early 70s, they must have thought we were thieves or beggars. We were nicely dressed and have been long-time Hilton customers. The disrespect and dismissive attitude by the lobby and bar staff was insulting. They ignored us for 20 minutes and the place was almost empty. We ended up leaving and spent our money elsewhere.  One word sums this place up... pretentious.  Avoid it and go elsewhere.","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/f4/38/e2/caption.jpg","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","en","Hilton Sorrento Palace","231243","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187782-d231243-r978136414-Hilton_Sorrento_Palace-Sorrento_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html"

It is a short walk to the main part of town and away from touristy areas. Coming back is a bit uphill but not too bad. Buffet breakfast has amazing view and great staff. Highly recommend this place. 

Sorrento vs Naples is a big question that I had for visiting Amalfi. No question : Sorrento. We took Italo train from Rome and it comes with a bus service from Naples terminal to Sorrento, The train service from Naples to Sorrento which we took as part of a Pompeii tour: not recommended at all as it is crowded. 

To get to Naples airport early early in the morning was another worry: the hotel arranged a private car service and added it to our room and it was impeccable too. Expensive but worth it. So overall not recommended to stay in Naples if you want to visit capri and Amalfi etc","1","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-25","2024-10-25","en","Hilton Sorrento Palace","231243","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187782-d231243-r976625503-Hilton_Sorrento_Palace-Sorrento_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html"
