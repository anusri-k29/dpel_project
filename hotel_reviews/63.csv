I will be coming here next year. I was with my young child and was glad to be in this space - a very short walk to everything!","0","","FAMILY","2024-11-30","2024-11-04","2024-11-04","en","Hotel Diocleziano","597288","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d597288-r978661595-Hotel_Diocleziano-Rome_Lazio.html"

The staff was so kind and helpful.  They found a place to store our bike bags for us and gave us breakfast bags both mornings when we left early.  Our room was very clean and comfortable.  The location was perfect, so close to the Rome Termini and to restaurants.  I really appreciated the kindness of the hotel staff.","0","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-10-28","2024-10-28","en","Hotel Diocleziano","597288","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d597288-r976999081-Hotel_Diocleziano-Rome_Lazio.html"

We can’t wait to return to Rome and make this our go-to spot. The hotel was super accessible, clean, and the customer service was truly fantastic! It’s conveniently located near Termini, making it easy to explore all the must-see sites like the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, and Trastevere. Every single staff member was amazing and added to our wonderful experience! Thank Nichola, Leonardo, and all the staff. 🙌🏼🥰","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-23","2024-10-23","en","Hotel Diocleziano","597288","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d597288-r976393609-Hotel_Diocleziano-Rome_Lazio.html"

The room was clean, the bed comfortable and has a bathroom with a rain shower. Breakfast was included in the price we paid and is not to be missed with a wide selection of sweet and savoury items, eggs, bacon and excellent coffee including, of course, unlimited cappuccinos. The reception staff were friendly and always helpful. If you have to check out early, they will provide a breakfast box. The hotel is within walking distance of many of the most important tourist sites. There are a few stairs to climb to reach the elevator which is small but can take two persons with baggage. We would stay here again without hesitation.","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-17","2024-10-17","en","Hotel Diocleziano","597288","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d597288-r974281966-Hotel_Diocleziano-Rome_Lazio.html"

Flawless breakfast, rich and complete, also very friendly staff.
The room was clean and the bathroom was comfortable.
He deserves to stay there as the cost benefit ratio is very good.

Nice sized room and bathroom, beds not the most comfortable but after walking miles around this city, they gave us a good night sleep.  Location is okay if you like walking about 20-25 minutes to the Trevi, Spanish steps.  Very close to the train station about 5 minutes if you would prefer public transport.  The hotel was small but comfortable very friendly staff and the breakfast was continental but varied.","0","","FRIENDS","2024-10-31","2024-10-09","2024-10-09","en","Hotel Diocleziano","597288","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d597288-r973172061-Hotel_Diocleziano-Rome_Lazio.html"

The staff are so welcoming and helpful. Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend if you are visiting Rome. Our room was so spacious and had every amenity you needed for your stay.

Sleep Quality: 3","Convenient to Stazione Termini","Pro's:  Nearly across the street from Stazione Termini and next door to the Diocletian Baths.  Front desk receptionists are eager to assist.  Room is clean, average sized and comfortable except for the hard mattress on the bed.  Breakfast is full of fresh savory and sweet selections from breads to pastries to beverages to meats, eggs, fruit, yogurt and more.  Towels in bath were of good quality and somewhat thick.
Challenges:  Not handicapped accessible as there is a stairway to reach the elevator.  Breakfast does not begin until 7:30 am which is a challenge for folk who rise early or have early appointments.  There is no bottled water complimentary in the room.  Room rate is somewhat high
Would I return to stay at this hotel?  Maybe.  Would I recommend it to others?  Yes.","1","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-09-12","2024-09-12","en","Hotel Diocleziano","597288","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d597288-r969483552-Hotel_Diocleziano-Rome_Lazio.html"

The location is ideal, well connected , close to the main attractions.

 The staff was extremely helpful upon arrival. The check-in went very well, they explained us very clearly the map of the city and they answered all our questions. Throughout the stay they were attentive to our needs, making sure everything went smoothly. 

Breakfast was delicious, with excellent variety, perfect for a good start to the day.","0","","COUPLES","2024-08-31","2024-08-29","2024-08-29","en","Hotel Diocleziano","597288","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d597288-r967322015-Hotel_Diocleziano-Rome_Lazio.html"
