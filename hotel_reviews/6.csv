The staff are great and super helpful. The butler service made the stay even better, I informed them before my trip that I was celebrating my wedding anniversary and they asked me loads of questions about my wife and I. With that information they made us a personalised cake that captured every thing about us. It was truly amazing and thoughtful. With that I want to say thanks to Hrithik and his team for making the stay memorable. The food at the hotel was also another attraction, especially the breakfast spread.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/fc/5d/a4/caption.jpg","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-11-02","2024-11-02","en","The St. Regis Mumbai","2311683","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d2311683-r978333202-The_St_Regis_Mumbai-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html"

I would especially like to commend Ms Prerna Kaushal, who provided me with impeccable butler services during my stay. Prerna was always available a message away and responded to all my requirements promptly which was a godsend.","0","","BUSINESS","2024-10-31","2024-11-01","2024-11-01","en","The St. Regis Mumbai","2311683","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d2311683-r978214313-The_St_Regis_Mumbai-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html"

The room was rather on the small side and the bathroom was cramped. No upgrade (titanium), did not push for it as I checked in  late at night. 

At the hotel the staff was very friendly and helpful, before the stay I tried to book an airport pick up, and it was unexpectedly complicated with the hotel not answering emails for days. 

The gym is really big and they have a nice pool. 
The breakfast was excellent with a lot of choices.","0","","SOLO","2024-07-31","2024-11-01","2024-11-01","en","The St. Regis Mumbai","2311683","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d2311683-r978211137-The_St_Regis_Mumbai-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html"

The service was superb.
The hotel was super clean. 
They have the best gym I have ever used in a city. 
Breakfast was fab, as was dinner in Seven Kitchens.
We thought the pool was good.
Service by the pool was a bit sparse.
The spa and changing rooms are beautiful.","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-29","2024-10-29","en","The St. Regis Mumbai","2311683","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d2311683-r977126766-The_St_Regis_Mumbai-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html"

Room size, staff, breakfast everything was good. This is not my first stay and had stayed earlier. Noticed the service, everything is good then and now. Breakfast variety was very good and so also the team in the hotel.
