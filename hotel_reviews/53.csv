Food? Excellent. Staff? Simply the best. Swimming pool. X No! But, if you are so minded, transport will be provided to go up to their sister hotel, 45 minutes further up in the hills, The Wild Flower. In an ideal World I would have 2/3 days at the Cecil (great location for taking in all the sights & history of the area) and then 2/3 nights at the Wild Flower for it's tranquility, gardens and views (and the highest swimming pool in the World?) Overall, probably one of the best city hotels in The World.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-11-05","2024-11-05","en","The Oberoi Cecil, Shimla","304233","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d304233-r978787169-The_Oberoi_Cecil_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html"

There is a quiet and relaxing ambiance throughout the hotel. Lots of seating areas in the hotel. Small ‘garden’ area across the main road opposite the hotel. Excellent buffet breakfast with a selected hot menu cooked to order. Currently the swimming pool is being refurbished but the hotel provides transport to Wildflower Hotel which is 45 minutes away; the pool and jacuzzi were outstanding as the property is located in beautiful grounds with stunning views.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-26","2024-10-26","en","The Oberoi Cecil, Shimla","304233","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304552-d304233-r976695075-The_Oberoi_Cecil_Shimla-Shimla_Shimla_District_Himachal_Pradesh.html"

It is very elegant and the rooms are stylish, tasteful and well equipped. We had lovely views over the hills. Each room comes with a charming little booklet on the history of the hotel.
There is a lovely bar with live piano music every evening and great cocktails. 
Breakfast was delicious with a large, multi - cuisine buffet and plenty of freshly cooked items. Dinner was delicious with a massive choice of options.
The best thing about the hotel though was the service. Staff were unfailingly helpful and provided a personalised service. They remembered what we had had for breakfast on our first day and provided suggestions based on that on subsequent days! They also provided a surprise birthday cake and balloons for my wife!","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/df/94/93/caption.jpg
