I booked the Royal Club Room. I gave my feedback directly to the hotel and they addressed it in the best possible way. Service in the club lounge is on a very high level. Special thanks to Ayan who made it a memorable stay for us, and to Vivek for his professional attitude and working hard towards maintaining the hotel's high standing. I was upgraded to the Executive Suite so the pictures show the upgraded room. ","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2e/08/4c/39/caption.jpg
