Plenty of shops, cafes, and restaurants nearby though it doesn't feel as tourist-y as other parts of the city. 
Hotel itself is just ok. The lady working the desk in the afternoon was surly, giving us a hard time for wanting a 2nd key to our room. The rooms are small, the furniture is uncomfortable, and we have several plumbing issues in both rooms.","1","","FAMILY","2024-09-30","2024-09-28","2024-09-28","en","Hotel De Varenne","282879","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d282879-r971707664-Hotel_De_Varenne-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"

However, I could not control the a/c from my room and had to call the front desk anytime I wanted a change in temperature.  Also, housekeeping staff entered my room despite a ""Do not Disturb"" sign posted.","1","","NONE","2024-09-30","2024-09-26","2024-09-26","en","Hotel De Varenne","282879","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d282879-r971456679-Hotel_De_Varenne-Paris_Ile_de_France.html"
