Freitags und Samstags ist speziell in einem Club sehr laute Musik und der Club hat bis 5:00 morgens geöffnet. Bei Übernachtungen an diesen Tagen unbedingt ein Zimmer nehmen, dass davon nicht betroffen ist! Ansonsten findet man keine Ruhe.","0","","COUPLES","2024-11-30","2024-11-02","2024-11-02","de","DoubleTree by Hilton Perth Northbridge","14887841","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255103-d14887841-r978356615-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Perth_Northbridge-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html"

The rooms are modern and well appointed - light and bright in the day and with block out blinds and curtains for the night. Beds are super comfortable with big pillows.

The bathroom has a great well lit mirror, shower has great water pressure and the handwash, body lotion, shampoo and conditioner are all Crabtree and Evelyn - wonderful!

I've stayed in Perth, at the Waterfront but keep coming back to Doubletree Northbridge because of the great vibe, James St Bar and Kitchen (fabulous breakfast, cocktails) and the staff who give amazing customer service!

I was sitting upright in my bed at 2:35 and could not fall back asleep as the windows and walls were vibrating. The staff was lovely and moved me for the next nights which definitely helped. They really should triple glaze the windows","0","","BUSINESS","2024-10-31","2024-10-29","2024-10-28","en","DoubleTree by Hilton Perth Northbridge","14887841","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255103-d14887841-r977071205-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Perth_Northbridge-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html"

I had a problem with an inactive link online for parking. Also I was confused about who I was meant to ring to ask questions. I had two numbers and eventually someone answered.
While I was there staff were very welcoming. The process was easy to get to my room. But I was told I didn’t have to use my card to go down but not that I had to use it between all the floor. I had to ask and found other clients were helping me and I was helping them to use the lifts.
The room was very nice but no labels or a list on what all the buttons around the room were for. Both my family member unintentionally open that blind over the shower. Without fully understanding what blind was. I could only hear a small noise while I had a shower. A small poster explaining what blind does would take care of that. Because I have never seen a  room shared blind on shower.
In regards recovers to asking for a handful of uht milk.The lady forgot to put milk in the fridge because anhe didn’t listen to what I said at the start.After having three conversations with people. Two times to the same reception person and one to the female host of the restaurant staff who promised a handful of milk would come up to our room.
My mum likes coffee and wasn’t well which why she was in her room during your hotel cleaning time. 
The young blond guycontacted I’m guessing housekeeping. The second time when I started to speak and say I had been there two times he cut me off and said I had been there once. This is not how customer service is conducted. You say how may I help you and be prepared to listen. Tell them what has happened. Then offer to take action. And let them know that you are sorry again and that the information will be passed on to housekeeping, hospitality department and management. Then the customer should be contacted by management and either offer something in the way of an apology or let the customer know all the actions that have been taken. I think was 3.5 hours it took to resolute this issue and receive the milk. And no follow up was done. I have worked within this industry and know how hard people work. But the communication in person and through online documentation needs to be fixed and reviewed. I also don’t how my mum would cope with all your digital reliance as she has no computer skills. I don’t k ow if there is a hard copy of your room manual available for use.I don’t know if I ever want to visit a Hilton Hotel again.  I never felt like this way before.","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-21","2024-10-21","en","DoubleTree by Hilton Perth Northbridge","14887841","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255103-d14887841-r974880282-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Perth_Northbridge-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html"

I had slight reservations about the area, but far from feeling threatened, I had the best selection of nice restaurants, bars and cafes and was on the doorstep to great museums.

The rooms are modern and have great amenities, lots of charging points and comfy beds. Good coffee machines and a fridge. 

Breakfast was fantastic with a different selection each day and the host made such an effort to make you feel welcomed and to check up on you when you approached her each morning.

Reception staff on both stays were really helpful and were accommodating to my early check in and late check out requests. Much appreciated due to the weird flight times I somehow managed to book.

Pool area great for relaxing by. Didn’t get to visit the gym as I had a lot of tours booked (they all offer hotel pick up) from the Doubletree.

I ordered takeaway one night from the Fat Indian Restaurant on level 1, great food and generous portions.

Really great hotel in a great location. I fell in love with Western Australia and will definitely choose this hotel on future visits to Perth. Highly recommended.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/cc/db/9b/caption.jpg","SOLO","2024-10-31","2024-10-16","2024-10-15","en","DoubleTree by Hilton Perth Northbridge","14887841","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255103-d14887841-r974091502-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Perth_Northbridge-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html"

My wife really appreciated the separate gluten-free section at breakfast and gluten-free options in the restaurant.

However, it’s location leaves a lot to be desired as it is opposite a massage parlour, peep show venue and a couple of sex shops.
It is also surrounded by nightclubs.

Our problems started on our second night when the room was physically vibrating to the music from a nearby nightclub.
I went down to reception at just after midnight to find out where the noise was coming from and to complain to the night staff.
The music continued until 5am so we got no sleep whatsoever.

I complained again in the morning and was told it would be passed on to the day manager.

Despite clearly explaining that we were out for the day and uncontactable, the Guest Relations Manager sent me an email message during the morning with a deadline of midday to decide if we wanted to move rooms or transfer to their sister hotel.
I did not physically receive that email until we returned to the hotel later that day.

We then spoke to duty manager, Amy Tran, who was absolutely terrific.
She explained our choices and personally helped us move all our belongings to a new room.

The new room still suffered from noise but we were able to muffle it by turning up the air conditioning and at least this room was not vibrating.

If you want a good night’s sleep, don’t stay here.","0","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-10-15","2024-10-15","en","DoubleTree by Hilton Perth Northbridge","14887841","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255103-d14887841-r974022498-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Perth_Northbridge-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html"
