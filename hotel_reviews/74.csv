Plus:
Very comfortable bedding 
Nice room at good temperature 
Very nice pool area 
Generally very friendly staff 
Excellent breakfast 

Less: 
No explanation at Check in on the facilities 
Request for twin beds before arrival and confirmed at Check in, and double bed on arrival in the room 
Most unpleasant: the security guard who asks us for our magnetic cards while we are in the lounge chairs! I specify that we are 6 people sitting in the hall and he asked us only! Really very embarrassing 😐 
Placement at breakfast: well at the bottom of the pergola, when we wished to be in the room. We were told that there was no more room, despite empty tables (Maybe reserved for an elite?) So we found ourselves next to safety barriers and a tarpaulin masking work, with the sound of drills and others .. For a hotel of this standing, it is average... 

I thought about the security guard and the double bed to the lovely young lady present at the check out, very professional and pleasant. 

In short, a bit of the impression that not everyone is housed at the same sign .. It’s a shame.. And a little disappointing. 

Oh yes, I forgot... Limestone on the shower head, Same for a luxury hotel, I don’t find it normal.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/fd/80/8e/caption.jpg","FAMILY","2024-11-30","2024-11-02","2024-11-02","en","Hotel Martinez Cannes","219369","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187221-d219369-r978413304-Hotel_Martinez_Cannes-Cannes_French_Riviera_Cote_d_Azur_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azu.html"

From the moment I arrived, the service has been impeccable. The staff went above and beyond to ensure my stay was perfect, always greeting me with a smile and ready to assist with any request. Special thanks to Navila the Guest Manager, and to Yanis from the restaurant.

The highlight of my stay is the breathtaking sea view from my room 322. Waking up to the sound of the waves and the sight of the azure Mediterranean is truly a dream come true. The hotel’s elegant design and luxurious amenities made for an unforgettable experience.

The pool  is very enjoyable although a bit fresh water, the Daurade de mami is fantastic at the on site restaurant Le Sud, and the beach is just so beautiful, every moment was a delight. If you’re looking for a slice of paradise in Cannes, the Martinez Hotel is the place to be!

Thanks Again :) For this wonderful stay, looking forward to coming back.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/f0/c7/30/caption.jpg
