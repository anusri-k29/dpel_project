We stayed in a Club Room which was spacious, and had a massive shower! Our room was ready early which was a pleasant surprise, and I also really appreciated the small touches such as the personalised card and fruit basket in the room :-)

The Club Lounge was definitely a highlight. The tiered afternoon tea was my favourite, while the evening drinks were excellent, as was breakfast. I’ve stayed in many 5 star hotels, but the view over the water from this one from the lounge really is beautiful :-)

The staff were exceptional throughout our stay, and I want to say thank you to Jordie for making our stay super special :-)

I’m looking forward to returning in the future :-)","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-13","2024-10-13","en","InterContinental Wellington, an IHG hotel","276184","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255115-d276184-r973801337-InterContinental_Wellington_an_IHG_hotel-Wellington_Greater_Wellington_North_Isla.html"

The InterContinental provided to be a great choice and well worth it to pay extra for Club access and a harbor view. The Club provided breakfast as well as evening hors d'oeuvres that made additional dinner not necessary. (The hors d'oeuvres were less impressive than some Marriott M Clubs I've been to, but still decent.) The excellent chefs make tasty omelette and egg sandwiches for breakfast. Also, the Club staff  -- and all the staff, including the front desk -- were friendly and helpful. I also liked that the rooms were modern. And again, what a view of the harbor!","4","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/29/9a/7e/a2/caption.jpg","SOLO","2023-06-30","2023-06-28","2023-06-28","en","InterContinental Wellington, an IHG hotel","276184","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255115-d276184-r898736984-InterContinental_Wellington_an_IHG_hotel-Wellington_Greater_Wellington_North_Isla.html"

Nice and spacious and loved the fact that you can open the window slightly for fresh air (kudos to the engineers who designed it to withstand Welly's wind). From arrival, everything was seamless. We rolled up in the hire car and the concierge was very prompt with taking our luggage and by the time we returned after we had dropped off the hire car, not only did they allow early check-in but all the luggage was already in the room. The position of the hotel is great, numerous restaurants and cafes in the immediate vicinity, plus the main shopping street was 2 blocks away. The club lounge access really made this stay, the breakfast was excellent as were the evening snacks and cocktails. The afternoon tea was OK. Thank you to Jecelle for her professional hospitality at breakfast and to Delphine for her charming service and excellent cocktail making skills and to David for his service. The concierge also organised our airport transfer upon departure making the stay from start to finish worry-free and very pleasant. Thank you for a great stay.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/b2/13/db/caption.jpg

You get treated like royalty to the extent that I didn't want to leave and go back to the real world . I can't see any reason to complain, when staying in such luxury. The massive tv in centre of room was an odd touch, but quirky. The staff were wonderful. There were a couple of little oopsies, such as cancelling our cards so we couldn't use the lift after 10am even though they'd agreed to a late checkout time. On balance, they were super prompt with delivering our suitcases to the room before we even got up there, and bringing the car around when we left. I only stayed one night and didn't get a chance to explore the health and fitness area. I must return for longer next time!!","0","","COUPLES","2024-08-31","2024-09-22","2024-09-22","en","InterContinental Wellington, an IHG hotel","276184","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255115-d276184-r970913203-InterContinental_Wellington_an_IHG_hotel-Wellington_Greater_Wellington_North_Isla.html"

I mentioned at check-out that I was disappointed and suggested the cleaners close the door while in the bathroom to see how grubby it was and the curtains had dirty marks. I was disappointed with the breakfast service, which could have been more friendly. Breakfast was terrible and tasteless.  I will not recommend it or be back to stay.","0","","FRIENDS","2024-09-30","2024-09-04","2024-09-03","en","InterContinental Wellington, an IHG hotel","276184","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255115-d276184-r968215490-InterContinental_Wellington_an_IHG_hotel-Wellington_Greater_Wellington_North_Isla.html"

We didn’t eat dinner there, but breakfast was delicious and really stylishly done. The rooms were very comfortable with everything thought of and just as we wanted (including a well stocked minibar, which you no longer always get but which we always like). Lovely bar and a knowledgeable concierge who recommended a nice restaurant for us without having to think twice. Last but not least the service was great with everyone going the extra mile and nothing forgotten (plus our son is an All Blacks fan and was thrilled to hear they’d been staying recently when the receptionist noticed his All Blacks top). We’ll definitely be back next time we’re In Wellington.","0","","FAMILY","2024-08-31","2024-08-15","2024-08-15","en","InterContinental Wellington, an IHG hotel","276184","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255115-d276184-r965027612-InterContinental_Wellington_an_IHG_hotel-Wellington_Greater_Wellington_North_Isla.html"

Rooms: We had a small suite which is estimated to be 40 m2 and left nothing to be desired. Comfortable furniture, by no means worn out with an equally modern bathroom. 

Breakfast: Was ok, but here we wanted a little more choice in a hotel of this class...

Other: Many thanks to the concierge who supported us very much in the conversation with the police by phone due to our car departure (Plimmer towers, not hotel underground parking).

Conclusion: For us the top hotel in Wellington, which we would definitely choose again when visiting the city.","0","","COUPLES","2024-01-31","2024-07-11","2024-07-11","en","InterContinental Wellington, an IHG hotel","276184","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255115-d276184-r959015196-InterContinental_Wellington_an_IHG_hotel-Wellington_Greater_Wellington_North_Isla.html"

Club lounge staff all lovely people.. Tea time, Twilight drinks and breakfast were a delight and the harbour views from the Club lounge, stunning. IHG membership recognised and late checkout granted. Overnight stay exactly what we needed and could not have chosen a better hotel as Intercontinental Wellington delivered and more. Thanks, team! We will be back!!

Special mention to Patricia from reception and Jecelle from the Club Lounge. Splendid service received, thank you!! ❤️","2","","COUPLES","2024-06-30","2024-06-21","2024-06-21","en","InterContinental Wellington, an IHG hotel","276184","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255115-d276184-r956135488-InterContinental_Wellington_an_IHG_hotel-Wellington_Greater_Wellington_North_Isla.html"

It's a 10-15 minute Uber to Weta Workshop. It was winter and very cold when we visited and our Aircon wasn't working so we were upgraded to a nicer room. The indoor pool and spa are great but smaller kids that can't swim may need assistance as the pool is deep and has no shallow section. Spa pool was a great hot temperature perfect for the cold. Very good buffet breakfast. Within minutes here's a Belgian pub/cafe around the corner, a Sal's pizza, cafes and other dining places. Staff friendly but seem young and inexperienced. Particularly the reception staff. Great porter and concierge staff!","0","","FAMILY","2023-06-30","2024-06-05","2024-06-05","en","InterContinental Wellington, an IHG hotel","276184","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255115-d276184-r953907810-InterContinental_Wellington_an_IHG_hotel-Wellington_Greater_Wellington_North_Isla.html"

It seems odd that beer and wine is served with nibbles but cocktails are not. Or perhaps that is just poor staff training.  Certainly the bar staff did not care.  We would not go here again.
