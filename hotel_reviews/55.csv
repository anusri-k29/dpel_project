The staff were consistently courteous and attentive, and the housekeeping service was excellent. Kaushal and Darwraj were especially helpful and went above and beyond to ensure our comfort. We had a minor concern with the room,  but Santhosh, the housekeeping leader, took immediate action and personally checked in with us multiple times to ensure the issue was resolved and we were comfortable. I highly recommend this place for anyone visiting Dubai.","0","","FAMILY","2024-11-30","2024-11-05","2024-11-05","en","Hyatt Regency Dubai Creek Heights","7760386","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d7760386-r978780833-Hyatt_Regency_Dubai_Creek_Heights-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

Sleep Quality: 5","Pure Luxury","We stayed 2 nights with our family including two children aged 10 and 8.  We all had the most welcoming experience during our stay.  The suite and additional room were very well appointed.  Our dining experience in the Sufra Dining room was second to none, we were 4 Coeliacs and our requirements posed no difficulty to the very experienced staff.  The pool area was a haven during our stay and the children enjoyed it very much.  Definitely would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and their staff and would certainly choose for another visit in the future.
