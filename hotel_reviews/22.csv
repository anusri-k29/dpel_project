On the whole very good to highlight : Sleep quality and bed very good, selection & service in the executive lounge top, selection & service at breakfast in the restaurant excellent, check-in & check-out/concierge service great.
Point deduction is because the room was not 100% clean on arrival at the sink (spots & hair) and shower gel & co were not replenished. This was fixed after complaint and then perfectly cleaned.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-28","2024-10-28","en","Munich Marriott Hotel","199639","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187309-d199639-r977003551-Munich_Marriott_Hotel-Munich_Upper_Bavaria_Bavaria.html"

From the moment we sat down, Carlos was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu. He offered great recommendations and ensured our glasses were never empty. His genuine passion for service made us feel valued and welcome. If you visit, ask for Carlos—he's a standout!","1","","FAMILY","2024-08-31","2024-10-21","2024-10-21","en","Munich Marriott Hotel","199639","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187309-d199639-r974869208-Munich_Marriott_Hotel-Munich_Upper_Bavaria_Bavaria.html"

Staff was great, location is fantastic, rooms are clean and modernly appointed.  I last stayed here in 1994 and the hotel then had an upscale feel to it and really represented the Marriott brand very well and it still does.  Breakfast buffet was a great start to each day!  Hotel pool was a nice way to recover after a 'full day' at Oktoberfest.  Took the bus from the airport to the train station and walked the 10 minutes up to the hotel; did the same going back to the airport- was quick, easy, comfortable and a real godsend.  Already looking forward to my next visit to this property! :)","1","","FRIENDS","2024-09-30","2024-10-07","2024-10-07","en","Munich Marriott Hotel","199639","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187309-d199639-r973003325-Munich_Marriott_Hotel-Munich_Upper_Bavaria_Bavaria.html"

The location is convenient, with easy access to public transportation, making it a great base for exploring the city. The breakfast was excellent, with a wide variety of options to suit every taste, and the dining facilities were top-notch.

The hotel also has great amenities, including a well-equipped fitness center and relaxing wellness area, which added to the overall experience. Whether for business or leisure, I highly recommend Marriott Munich for a comfortable and enjoyable stay. I'll definitely return!","0","","FAMILY","2024-03-31","2024-09-28","2024-09-28","en","Munich Marriott Hotel","199639","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187309-d199639-r971677288-Munich_Marriott_Hotel-Munich_Upper_Bavaria_Bavaria.html"

After 30+ rings and no answer, I gave up. Twenty minutes later, I tried again and still no answer.  Room was very warm and did not cool off, so sleep was difficult.
Please be aware that the ""Champion's"" Sport Bar is currently closed until Sept/Oct 2024 due to remodeling and updating.
Lobby bar staff and ""Alexander"" at the front desk were very friendly and helpful during my stay.
Lesson learned however...Will bring my travel fan when traveling Europe in the summertime. AC was less than adequate.
