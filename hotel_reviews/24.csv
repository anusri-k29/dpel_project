Every single detail was immaculate - including the stunning entrance and foyer, beautiful presentation of the rooms, the generous champagne/ cake in our rooms, the attention to detail in the decor (I was there with an architect and designer and they were blown away), the amazing Auriga spa and above all the brilliant staff who could not do enough for us. They made us feel special throughout our visit. We had dinner at a top restaurant in the city and it was interesting to note that their level of service paled in comparison to the outstanding staff at the Capella. Can't say enough about how wonderful this was, I have stayed at fabulous hotels around the world and this is right up there. Do not miss the Auriga spa - even if you just use the pool/ hydrotherapy/ sauna/ steam room/ experience shower, it's beautiful. We stayed in premier king rooms that faced the city, but even the king rooms that face the atrium would be fabulous. Breakfast was extremely generous and very high quality. Loved every minute of this stay.","0","","FRIENDS","2024-10-31","2024-10-29","2024-10-29","en","Capella Sydney","25186641","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d25186641-r977189278-Capella_Sydney-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html"

A haven and sanctuary with the best most attentive service we have experienced in a 5 star hotel in Australia. Added bonus is the spa and heated swimming pool. Makes it hard to step outside!","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-28","2024-10-28","en","Capella Sydney","25186641","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d25186641-r977047890-Capella_Sydney-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html"

I sincerely apologise for my oversight.
We had a staycation there a little while ago and it was a most pleasant experience. What stood out for us is the service and the cosy feel. This is not a boutique hotel but it is certainly smaller than a lot of properties within walking distance of the Circular Quay.
While the staff are not high touch, you have the feeling that you are being looked after. They are always professional and courteous.
The property is housed in the former Department of Education building which was completely renovated and extended. Capella opened in March 2023 so it is a relatively new hotel. It is a couple blocks back from the harbour so you won't get a harbour view. However, being closer to the business side of the CBD certainly give off a different vibe which is not a bad thing.
While the amenities are modern, you can't escape the history of the site. To wit, they have culturalists on site that will brief you on the history of the nearby area and conduct small scheduled tours of the heritage building and the artworks within. That is quite unique.
We stayed in a Tower King room. It is a well appointed and spacious room made even larger via a couple of sliding doors which opens up the large bathroom. A normal door from the hallway gives you the same access if you want to close the sliding doors.
As you'd expect, all the high-end mod cons are present and well integrated into their ecosystem. However, this is where the little touches make a difference. For instance, my wife's pet hate is not being able to find a set of hotel slippers that fits her. Much to her surprise, she found a small and a large pair in the room and the small pair fits perfectly and are very comfortable. That definitely got a thumb up from her.
Oh, one more thing, the hotel has a proper turndown service. It is more than a mini room service. They also set out a bottle of water and a glass by your bed, both sides. They also move the TV remote to the beside table. Nice touch.
Ok, the elephant in the room. For a room of this standard, why is there no bath tub? I don't necessarily need one but its absence raised eyebrows. A mystery for another stay.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/b9/5a/42/caption.jpg

The only downfall was no one was at the Front Desk when I needed to checkout, and I had to grab a staff member of the Restaurant to find a member as I had to catch a flight and was panicking - I think it would be best to ensure there is always someone at the Desk please.

Deplorable
Shocking wait times
Very low quality and extremely odd food choices for a high tea, Champagne was good. Individual plates of seafood and then dishes meat were extremely odd choices for a high tea. The tuna on the seafood dish was very tasty.  The other two offerings were not. The wagu beef pie on the meat dish was good. The other two options were not. These plates were followed by individual plates of sweets which were unappealing and did not even taste fresh. The basket of scones was fresh but served with a small dish of jam between three people and a small dish of cream WHICH WAS SOUR CREAM!  If you wanted refills of tea, you could only choose one option, the house tea, otherwise you had to pay extra. Could not rate it low enough.

We were very impressed by the beautiful property, the design (with the amazing Studio Drift installation in the lobby), the spacious rooms with beautiful bathrooms, the fantastic spa and massages – and most of all, the super friendly and supporting staff.

Would highly recommend it for everyone travelling to Sydney and I really hope we will be back one day. Thank you Anthony, Jonathan and the entire team!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/2a/1c/d1/caption.jpg
