How wrong we were. We arrived before check in and the one person on duty was having her lunch and told us to come back in 40 minutes, we couldn't drop our bags or even go to the toilet! The whole hotel is tired, the room was spacious but needs to be updated particularly the bathrooms. Breakfast was poor. Staff were unwelcoming and so different from our experience at Milliken Creek. This was such a disappointment given our previous experience at Milliken Creek. The hotel is in a tremendous location overlooking Monterey bay. It could have so much to offer but urgently requires investment and a change in management to fulfil it’s potential.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-11-01","2024-11-01","en","Green Gables Inn A Four Sisters Inn","113636","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32840-d113636-r978306259-Green_Gables_Inn_A_Four_Sisters_Inn-Pacific_Grove_Monterey_County_California.html"

Quick walk to Cannery Row or into town in Pacific Grove or to Lovers Point. It’s directly across the street from the ocean so the views are magnificent! The bike pathq is directly across the street and the hotel will provide you free of charge bikes. My husband and so went on an absolutely gorgeous 8 mile ride along the coast. Amazing! The main house: from the outside it’s a traditional looking home but inside the decorating was modern beach and stunning!!! It’s comfy yet fashionable! And the views are amazing! There are cookies all day , wine and cheese in the afternoon and a yummy breakfast each morning. We stayed in the back building and had an incredible suite with blocked views of the ocean. We had a fireplace , large sitting area, large bathroom with tub and separate shower and a king bed. The room was decorated beautifully. Our fireplace had some issues but they sent someone to fix it and also gave us a pretty significant credit (before we even had to ask) for our difficulty. The staff are kind and helpful. 5 stars all the way! We will be back!!!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/28/48/b4/caption.jpg

We stayed 2 nights. We were greeted with kindness and allowed early checkin. The inn was communicative and helpful. Recent renovations are clearly demonstrated  at this charming property. We enjoyed a variety of breakfast items with a great view of the ocean. The gas fireplace in our room was a nice touch. Looking forward to exploring other 4 sister properties in the future.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/8f/5e/b3/caption.jpg

Although the power was out across the Monterey Peninsula, we were warmly welcomed and every effort was made to make us comfortable.  Amy went out of her way to see that we were moved to the Green Gables’ sister inn until the power was restored.  She accomplished this seamlessly, with grace and efficiency, and with very little effort on our end.  All we had to do was move our luggage.   This hotel has the best view on the coast.  It was so beautiful that we opted to stay for a second night without power just to watch the otters in the bay.  If I’m ever lucky enough to return to Monterey, Green Gables would be my first choice of places to stay.  It was perfection.","1","","FRIENDS","2024-02-29","2024-02-12","2024-02-12","en","Green Gables Inn A Four Sisters Inn","113636","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32840-d113636-r937881440-Green_Gables_Inn_A_Four_Sisters_Inn-Pacific_Grove_Monterey_County_California.html"

The breakfast was delicious and we normally don't eat breakfast. It was nice to walk across the street and have a coastline walk path. We will be staying here again.","0","","COUPLES","2024-01-31","2024-01-22","2024-01-22","en","Green Gables Inn A Four Sisters Inn","113636","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32840-d113636-r935014373-Green_Gables_Inn_A_Four_Sisters_Inn-Pacific_Grove_Monterey_County_California.html"

The building is wonderful Victorian and beautifully decorated with taste. My room was superb- quiet, ocean view, comfortable bed, window seats, darkening shades, coffee, tea, fridge with filtered water, bikes to borrow, delicious breakfast, wine/cheese, and cookies, and more! I wanted to stay forever!","0","","SOLO","2023-11-30","2023-12-04","2023-12-04","en","Green Gables Inn A Four Sisters Inn","113636","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32840-d113636-r928420196-Green_Gables_Inn_A_Four_Sisters_Inn-Pacific_Grove_Monterey_County_California.html"

We were in The Carriage House (separate to the main house), on the top floor and the room was very big. There was a sofa area, two armchairs, fireplace and a very comfortable bed. In the sofa area was a pod based coffee machine and a small fridge that had chilled water in it. The bathroom was big with a bath that had a whirlpool (didn’t have time to use), two sinks and had some lovely toiletries. There was a walk-in shower which had plenty of room. Although no air con, it did have a fan to help following a very hot day in October. Breakfast the next morning was superb! Lots of choice and the sour cream coffee cake was amazing! The only downside was the water smelt and tasted salty plus you have to be careful of the shower door as it backs straight onto the bathroom door.  Amazing stay, with very friendly staff, great food and we would like to revisit for a longer stay. ","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2a/a4/fc/5b/caption.jpg

First time at Green Gables Inn and hands down this was one of the best experiences. Stayed in one of the Carriage House rooms. It was spacious, spotless, so comfortable, private, nice view. Staff were terrific - kind, helpful. Very good breakfast, and pleasant afternoon wine and cheese. Location perfect - easy walk to Aquarium, etc. Green Gables Inn will now absolutely be our ‘go-to’ accommodation when we head to the area.","0","","COUPLES","2023-10-31","2023-10-20","2023-10-20","en","Green Gables Inn A Four Sisters Inn","113636","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32840-d113636-r922162182-Green_Gables_Inn_A_Four_Sisters_Inn-Pacific_Grove_Monterey_County_California.html"
