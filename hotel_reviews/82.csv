The service was outstanding, and our wine glasses were refilled before they ran empty. Because it was both my sister's and my birthday, we were greeted with the cutest birthday slice and a birthday greeting from the staff. 5 stars service and food all around; can't wait for the next visit.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2e/05/15/e3/caption.jpg

Sleep Quality: 5","Quality, Classic, and Close to Trafalgar Square","When planning this trip to Europe, we wanted to pick hotels close to the action, but still true to the history of the city, more unique in nature. We also wanted a hotel with a goal of spending less time on the Underground, and more time seeing the sites. Several travel websites suggested the Royal Horseguards Hotel for convenience of walking. The hotel is amazing and truly is beautiful. The staff was kind, professional and friendly. What a room! Larger than anticipated and well-appointed. It is also a close walk from the Underground. And, walking to the sites was so quick and easy! Those travel websites did not lead me astray on the convenience of site-seeing. There are some great pubs near by. If you take the double decker buses for site seeing, several operators stop super close by. Check out the location on Google maps. You will be amazed at was in such close proximity. Bring your walking shoes!","0","","NONE","2024-10-31","2024-11-03","2024-11-03","en","The Royal Horseguards","193079","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d193079-r978543859-The_Royal_Horseguards-London_England.html"
