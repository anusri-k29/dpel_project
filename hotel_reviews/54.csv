But I would have not expected any less from the brand. 
Aya checked us in at reception. She has been very nice to us and gave us an upgrade. This was very much appreciated. 
All the housekeeping team on the 7th floor were amazing. I’m sorry I don’t remember their names. But everything we requested they honoured and the turn down service in the evening with the chocolates was a nice touch. 
Breakfast was amazing. So much variety on offer. Many thanks to Akshay and Samnath for looking after us. You were very busy with a wedding taking place at the hotel but your service was very prompt. 
Had a facial for 4 people at the spa. The treatment for all of us was amazing. Thank you to Wafae and the whole team. 
There was a bit of confusion with executive lounge service that came with the room. It was very quickly resolved. Francis and Osman were incredible with their hospitality in the lounge. And the food quality and quantity was very good. If you do get to experience this then please do. 
Last but not least thank you to Alyna (assistant guest sales manager) for taking care of the whole stay for us from before we arrived to us departing. We cannot thank you enough for everything you did for us. 
We would definitely come back here and recommend this hotel to anyone. We have stayed in quite a few hotels in Dubai as we are frequent travellers here. But this is now the place where we will look forward to coming again and again. 
Thank you for looking after me and my family. See you soon.","2","","FAMILY","2023-02-28","2023-02-17","2023-02-17","en","Palazzo Versace Dubai","7768334","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d7768334-r879065028-Palazzo_Versace_Dubai-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

There was a rat running in the central pool area. The sunbeds are holed, the towels are holed and have other people's hair, and there are stains of unwashed products. Slow and unfriendly service in the pool area. Not wanting to put on the pool, no one coming up and feeling like you're imposing and asking for attention. They didn't want to let me in once, so it's paid for. But when she said she was willing to pay and lived in a hotel, they just left... Kind of not a good guest. In the shower hygiene product, the hair balm was diluted with water. Little things like that are extremely unpleasant. Especially when instead of hair conditioner there's a diluted body cream. When we checked in, they said the amount we paid back immediately, but there was not enough $100-200 that we wanted to change in the exchanger, but the manager said that it was not possible and asked to give him a deposit in any currency, ostensibly it would be until we changed the currency🤦🏽‍’️then at the check-out we were returned some dirhams, saying that they took more, ostensibly for some expenditure. Although the room didn't have a minibar and about that, it's usually always warned, although it's a small thing, but it has to be. The only good thing is the room service staff. Cleaned up, guests in the form of sweets, extra hair conditioners and water were always in the room, a very nice young man, asking if we were happy and needed anything, I think his name was Tian.","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-11-01","2024-11-01","en","Palazzo Versace Dubai","7768334","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d7768334-r978255798-Palazzo_Versace_Dubai-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"
