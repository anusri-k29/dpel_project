The cleanliness unfortunately leaves much to be desired. The cobwebs were not removed despite a hint. We did it ourselves. That would still be acceptable. What is not ok, however, is that the restaurants supposedly only have seats available at 10:00 p.m. Unfortunately, this is not so appropriate with a 6-year-old child. At our request, this was justified by capacity problems. 

After another request there was suddenly a seat at 19:00, Only in the restaurant nobody knew about it. But since it was relatively empty, we could of course eat at 19:00. On Feb. Tag unfortunately the same topic. It was only on 2x indication of a 6-year-old that we got a table at 19:00. Unfortunately, nobody knew about the reservation in the restaurant this time. 

I had booked through a travel agent and had assumed that golf was included (at 18,000 EUR for 11 days...). This has apparently not been the case since August 2023. Just nobody told us. On our complaint we then got 5 green fees for free (allegedly). Because nobody knew about it on the golf course (so I paid for it. 

When I was just about to complain to the reception, I left after 15 minutes, as unfortunately no person responsible came. It's too bad. 

So 2 stars,w eil. The facility is really nice. But actually, I want to recover and not get angry. 

Too bad! Never again four seasons...","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-24","2024-10-24","en","Four Seasons Resort Mauritius at Anahita","1152299","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1152294-d1152299-r976435954-Four_Seasons_Resort_Mauritius_at_Anahita-Beau_Champ.html"

We had a great time, the villa was spacious and the pool was heated. The food was really good, we really liked the beach restaurant, lots of local fish. Special thanks to our villa cleaner, she did a great job and checked on us every day to see if we needed anything, she would run baths for us for when we got back after dinner. The Hotel is closing next year for a Refurb after Feb, the only thing we noticed that needed upgrading were the beach sunbeds as they were a bit short on padding.","0","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-10-13","2024-10-13","en","Four Seasons Resort Mauritius at Anahita","1152299","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1152294-d1152299-r973692087-Four_Seasons_Resort_Mauritius_at_Anahita-Beau_Champ.html"

Five star staff, food and setting.","Some of the reviews had made us apprehensive about our choice of staying here. We had booked six days here and four at Maradiva and wondering if we’d made a mistake and should have booked the whole stay at the Maradiva. We hadn’t! This hotel is absolutely superb! ( Maradiva was a disappointment - see separate review)

On arrival at 8 am we were immediately shown to a room. An upgrade from what we had booked. However our beach access room wasn’t yet available. We were offered the choice of staying in the ocean view or moving later on in the day to our original view. We opted to stay in the ocean view as it was more private albeit with no beach access. 

The Rooms 
The rooms are in need of slight updating but are luxurious and spacious. Clean and beautiful linen. 

The Hotel
The grounds of this hotel are absolutely beautiful. We walked everywhere and it’s all easily accessible. No need for golf carts. The flowers and trees are so well looked after. 

The beach
We took the speedboat each day to Ile aux cerfs. We loved this option. The beach is looked after by hotel staff and private. Rambo is at the bar and an absolute star. 

Swimming Pool
Beautiful swimming pool in an amazing setting. 

Spa 
We booked several treatments which were all wonderful. 

Gift shop
Lovely little gift shop where we bought several gifts before we left for family. All reasonably priced. 

Food 

Breakfast was busy but there was a huge selection and we were well looked after.  

Dinner - we were half board but used the credit with ease and simply added the cost onto what was on the menu. Special mention to the staff at the Upper Cut. We loved every meal we had. Five star food and five star staff. Only meal which didn’t work for us was on the beach bbq at Lazy Fish. 

If you are wondering if this is or isn’t the hotel for you, ignore the poor reviews. This is truly a wonderful hotel and we may well return. The staff are all kind caring attentive and also fun!

We loved every day with you. Five stars all round.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/c4/12/a5/caption.jpg

From the moment we arrived, everything was perfect. Amazing staff, beautiful location, awesome rooms and lovely food. Sleep quality fantastic!

The gym and tennis complex was great, our kids loved the teens club and the beach activities so fun. Didn't play golf unfortunately but the 2 courses looks very good.

We only did 3 nights but our entire family was sad to leave and wished we booked for longer.  Definitely coming back!","0","","FAMILY","2024-09-30","2024-10-03","2024-10-03","en","Four Seasons Resort Mauritius at Anahita","1152299","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1152294-d1152299-r972421042-Four_Seasons_Resort_Mauritius_at_Anahita-Beau_Champ.html"

The room we had was right on the beach with the perfect morning view but with tress on both sides giving you a privacy and intimate feel. It has everything comfort required, with excellent room service for the lazier days. 

Every meal was brilliant, but our favourite was Lazy fish which is right on the beach and prepared on a bbq. The fish was just superb! 

The whole team were phenomenal. Considering its a fairly big hotel, it had small hotel feel with everyone wishing you good morning, most remembering your name and always wanting to go the extra mile to ensure we had an excellent stay. What ever they are doing there, clearly works as its hands down the best hotel team we have ever experienced. 

Ensure you head to the spa. We had several treatments whilst there and was blown away every time at how amazing not only the staff were but the quality of the massages. The best we've had. A big thank you to our therapists Kavida and Charlotte who were both exceptional. 

If you fancy getting active head to the gym and do a lesson with Selvin who again, was a superb coach. He is excellent at analysing and pin pointing ways to improve your skill and take you to the next level. 

Its a trip we will never forget and cannot recommend it more highly to anyone considering. We will definitely be back!","0","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-10-02","2024-10-02","en","Four Seasons Resort Mauritius at Anahita","1152299","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1152294-d1152299-r972299038-Four_Seasons_Resort_Mauritius_at_Anahita-Beau_Champ.html"

What sets the hotel apart is the warmth and openness of all staff. You feel like you are in a big family from the beginning and you find everything your heart desires. We celebrated our silver wedding - everyone knew and spoiled us that day (even with a sunken bathtub with rose petals and extra long massages). The only downside is the location far away from everything touristic (no restaurants and nice boutiques within 45 minutes) and the roads are very adventurous and dangerous to drive by car. September is not the perfect time to visit because it is then winter and it rained briefly almost every day and was windy and cloudy. Tip: the area below the airport is very worth seeing (waterfalls and tea plantation - be sure to view)! We would definitely come back!","0","","FAMILY","2024-09-30","2024-09-29","2024-09-29","en","Four Seasons Resort Mauritius at Anahita","1152299","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1152294-d1152299-r971809825-Four_Seasons_Resort_Mauritius_at_Anahita-Beau_Champ.html"

We have been to some top hotels around the world, Sandy Lane, Barbados, Burj al Arab, Dubai and many many others and the service that we have received here is far above any hotel we have ever stayed at.

The team were consistent from start to finish. It wasn’t any particular area or restaurants, they were all equally as brilliant as each other. So attentive, friendly and efficient. We were never kept waiting for anything. 

The free facilities on the beach were great, we did a couple of tours too and even they were so helpful and friendly. 

Everyone is an absolute credit to the management team at this resort. 

Keep up the great work. 
We will definitely be back.","0","","NONE","2024-09-30","2024-09-29","2024-09-29","en","Four Seasons Resort Mauritius at Anahita","1152299","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1152294-d1152299-r971805829-Four_Seasons_Resort_Mauritius_at_Anahita-Beau_Champ.html"

The staff was incredible and was constantly finding ways to make our trip even better. From a surprise boat ride, to golf, spa treatments and even special dessert and drinks every night, the hospitality was truly one of the best we have ever seen. The food was insanely good at each restaurant and we never left a meal hungry. We are so grateful for this hotel and could not have asked for a better resort to stay at for our honeymoon.
