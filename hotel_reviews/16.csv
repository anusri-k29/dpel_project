Buona la colazione e buono e comodo il ristorante a buffet per la cena o il pranzo. Camere non nuovissime ma molto confortevoli e spaziose.

Insgesamt waren wir mit kleineren Abstrichen sehr zufrieden. Die Lage ist topp (100m von der Metro entfernt). Die Mitarbeiter sind alle unglaublich bemüht, einen weiter zu helfen. Für uns Deutsche war Deniz natürlich ein Schatz. Wir konnten ihn alles fragen und wusste auch immer eine Lösung. Unser Zimmer (vielen Dank für das Upgrade) war groß, absolut ausreichend. Besonderen Dank hier an Judy. Es war immer wieder frisches Zimmer vorhanden.
Die Abstriche machen wir beim Pool, welcher gemessen an der Anzahl der Hotelgäste einfach zu klein ist.
Wir hatten Übernachtung mit Halbpension gebucht. Das Frühstück war perfekt. Beim Mittag/ Abendessen dauerte es oft zu lange, bis das Essen in den Töpfen wieder nachgefüllt wurde. Wir würden das nächste Mal nur Frühstück nehmen.
Vielen Dank an das Hotel für die schönen Tage!
