Navigating the building was inconvenient, requiring multiple elevators and frequent encounters with both residents and visitors, affecting comfort. Additionally, the reception process was delayed, and the attentiveness we’ve come to expect was lacking. It’s best to adjust expectations for the overall experience","0","","NONE","2024-10-31","2024-11-02","2024-11-01","en","One&Only One Za'abeel","26432664","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d26432664-r978324400-One_Only_One_Za_abeel-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

Poor management. No attention to guests satisfaction. Extremely disappointing for a hotel of this price. Problems were there 6 months ago and nothing has been solved! How is it possible?

But it was adversited as family friendly!! Also, the pool is always full and we have to wait around 10 minutes in the indoor seating area just for seats by the pool!

On the other hand, the staff made our stay very pleasant. Mohammed Akram and Sayam greeted us all the time and cleaned our rooms to a very high standard. They always checked on us and gave us everything we needed for our stay to as comforting as we wanted it to be. 

The hotel has A LOT of potential, as we can clearly see. The architecture is amazing and has the potential for many more awesome facilities. 

Overall, the hotel is not family friendly but it has a lot of potential. The staff are also very friendly and kind.","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-28","2024-10-28","en","One&Only One Za'abeel","26432664","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d26432664-r976983572-One_Only_One_Za_abeel-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

Initially, I was impressed by the hotel''s luxury and warm welcome from the Captain, adding a nice touch of stay. But I noticed that their attention was more about amenities that needed extra payment, while the price of the room itself was high. It was better for hotel owners to have access to all the facilities for free.

The room setting was not cool enough, impacting our comfort during our stay. The elevator system is unworkable and complex. After using the pool, I had to change the elevator twice, forcing me to walk in front of the crowd, which is not suitable at all. You need some improvements to the overall experience.","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-27","2024-10-27","en","One&Only One Za'abeel","26432664","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d26432664-r976811749-One_Only_One_Za_abeel-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"
