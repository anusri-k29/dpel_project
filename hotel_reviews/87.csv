The lessons were excellent, perhaps the very best I've ever experienced.  (And I have had a lot of lessons at a lot of places.)   Brendan was able to quickly diagnose some technical flaws in my groundstrokes, volleys, and serve.  More importantly, he gave me concrete, actionable advice on how to remedy the flaws and constructed specific, thoughtful drills designed to help me implement his advice.  He also carries in his tennis bag a picture book of professional tennis photos that help illustrate proper technique, and he used it to help me visualize some of the ideas he was sharing.  And I should add that it was really fun to hit with him.  The three Har-Tru artificial clay courts, by the way, are immaculately maintained, and I suspect that they are cooler under the Arizona sun than hard courts would be","0","","BUSINESS","2024-10-31","2024-10-28","2024-10-28","en","Arizona Biltmore, LXR Hotels & Resorts","115484","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d115484-r976985801-Arizona_Biltmore_LXR_Hotels_Resorts-Phoenix_Arizona.html"

I enjoyed the soaps and shower gel/shampoo. The pools were absolutely outstanding. Very nice temperature and I believe they use salt water pools which is better for your skin and overall health. Towels were plentiful. Great evening events and entertainment. Tennis courts were very nice with clay and hard court options. Would definitely stay again!

Last year although I loved everything, I complained about some of the prices.
Well, they're still high, but I know all the big resorts are the same. I really do have to say what a great place this is: the Spire Bar, grounds, rooms, pools, are exceptional. In particular I want to mention Taylor, at the Paradise Pool. She was so wonderfully helpful, friendly, and just an overall nice person. Also a shout-out to Tom in the Cup and Cone, who remembered me from last year!
Can't wait to visit again.","0","","SOLO","2024-10-31","2024-10-16","2024-10-16","en","Arizona Biltmore, LXR Hotels & Resorts","115484","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d115484-r974205307-Arizona_Biltmore_LXR_Hotels_Resorts-Phoenix_Arizona.html"

We spent over $1,000 for two nights. What a horrendous waste of money!!! It calls into question all Hilton hotels tehse days, and rebranding under the LXR name didn't make it any better, only worse!  I RECOMMEND AVOIDING THIS HOTEL!","0","","COUPLES","2024-08-31","2024-10-15","2024-10-15","en","Arizona Biltmore, LXR Hotels & Resorts","115484","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d115484-r974074527-Arizona_Biltmore_LXR_Hotels_Resorts-Phoenix_Arizona.html"

It was very hot, but we still were able to hike in the AM, played in a pickleball and tennis clinic, had a semi private, and private lesson. Brendan did a great job keeping the clinics fun and gave me some great tips to improve my serve, court movement, backhand slice and volleys during our tennis lessons. There was a variety of skill level at the camps and the drills, but we all got a good workout and had a great time.","0","","FAMILY","2024-09-30","2024-10-15","2024-10-15","en","Arizona Biltmore, LXR Hotels & Resorts","115484","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d115484-r974073158-Arizona_Biltmore_LXR_Hotels_Resorts-Phoenix_Arizona.html"

- beautiful grounds, pools
- not very far from Phoenix airport
- pool bar is beautiful by night

Negatives:
- outdated rooms.  Our bathroom has the same tile and furnishings as my 15 year old bathroom, which needs gutting. 
-  bad shower, shampoo and conditioner awful. Very poor for a hotel of this class. Shower head was pathetic and cheap. 
- our room had an adjoining door which leaked light and sound. It was as if there was no door in terms of sound. 
- restaurants are expensive for what they are

This is a very big resort with many buildings and pools.  It takes a bit of time to get around. They claim you can ask a golf cart to take you places but I never saw people being driven around. We asked on the first night, as we didn’t know where we were going n the dark and with luggage in tow, and were blown off. They said it would take 5-7 minutes walking to get there and encouraged us to do so on our own. Not very hospitable! 

The beautiful pool you see in the pics is only available to 21+.  So if you have kids, you have to go to another pool.  The other pools have no food or drink service. 

I likely wouldn’t return. For the price this place didn’t impress me that much.","1","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-14","2024-10-14","en","Arizona Biltmore, LXR Hotels & Resorts","115484","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d115484-r973916538-Arizona_Biltmore_LXR_Hotels_Resorts-Phoenix_Arizona.html"

If they see of your brown and on public canal property they call the cops on you. Was on public property on the canal charging my board when they sicked their security guard and threatened to call the police because “we were making them nervous” just by sotting there charging my board. We all know what they mean by “making them nervous” people of color making them nervous","1","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-05","2024-10-05","en","Arizona Biltmore, LXR Hotels & Resorts","115484","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d115484-r972704387-Arizona_Biltmore_LXR_Hotels_Resorts-Phoenix_Arizona.html"

Comfortable. Air conditioning needs work","The Biltmore is a beautiful hotel situated about 15-20 minutes from the phoenix airport. The pools and gym are very nice. The room is large and spacious however needs work on the air conditioning and maintenance. My air would turn off in the middle of the day and the room would be 80 degrees and take about 2 hours to cool down. The restaurant in the hotel is decent. Caution that you have to walk outside a lot to get from building to building so bring comfortable shoes and light clothing. Watch for fire ants and scorpions!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/b0/a9/c8/caption.jpg

I booked my room through an online booking platform and not the hotel website, this was seemingly my first offense because each and every agent made it a point to make a comment about it. Anyway when we arrived on the 25th an agent by the name of Bre checked us in, she “upgraded” our room purportedly free of charge (my bill says different) and we were on our way. As we were walking to the room I had a feeling of being unwelcomed but brushed it off. Got off the elevator and I can tell you the hallway was in shambles, the wallpaper was peeling and it felt old and dreary. When we got to the room the bathroom was so small but the room itself was huge, from the dust on the lampshade I could tell it hadn’t been properly cleaned so I called the front desk and spoke to a lady named Dominique I explained that the room was not suitable and that I came to celebrate my birthday if I could change rooms she was nice enough called me back said she spoke with her manager and that I could get a Cabin room the next day for an extra $200 a night, I agreed because I just wanted to enough my birthday. The next day was the 26th my bday, my husband and I went for brunch and on our return to the Hotel we stopped at the ice cream shop “Cup and Cone”. There were two ladies behind the counter a younger brunette lady and a blonde haired older lady, well I can tell you that the old lady looked at us with such disgust that I was stunned. She had an attitude and it was evident they didn’t want to serve us. We got our ice cream and left btw the ice cream was so bland in taste it wasn’t worth the money we spent. My husband and I sat in some of the chairs they had on the sidewalk and ate the ice cream we spoke of our experience and how uncomfortable it made us and I said to him “racist really amuse me, if you don’t like people of color then just go and live off the grid” at that moment we were approached by an African American gentleman who said he was checking out because he was charged a historical fee but the people who were not of color who he came with was not charged the same fee. When he enquired why he was charged they could not give a satisfactory response, I wish to state that I too was charged the same fee at $11 a day. After that interaction I had very low hopes for the day, I went to the spa, the employees were nice however the guest all acted as if they had seen a foreign object whilst I was amused it did not make for a good day as I did not take advantage of the lounge area really and left soon after my treatment was done also the lady that did my facial was asking me some weird question in the lounge area in front of everyone as to whether or not I saw a horse in some weird sculpture I said yes so she would leave me alone and then she said hmmmm no one ever sees it I said ok and took a seat wth!! Anyway as I was to be relocated to the Cabin, I had been calling since the morning and was given the run around we even visited the front desk where the Agent reviewed the notes and laughed in our face, I was thinking what’s going on. In any event at 3:00 pm I said to my husband they are going to wait until 4:00 pm on the dot before they call us. So said so done at 4:05pm we received a call saying the room was ready a bellman would come and get our things. I can tell you that they put us at the very back of the property in a Cabin with no view and an accessibility room at this point I was too drained and disturbed to complain, whilst the room was nice, it wasn’t nice to have a shower and have the entire bathroom soaked and placed at the very back like unwanted trash. We did not bother eating at the restaurants or doing anything on premise because we just felt unwanted so we spent most of our time either in town or in the room at the back. This was by far my worst travel experience. I’ve traveled the world all over Europe and the US and never have I felt so unwanted and judged. If you’re a person of color this place is not for you I fear take your money and go elsewhere.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/ae/e5/94/caption.jpg
