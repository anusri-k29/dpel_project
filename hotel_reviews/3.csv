We checked into the Atlantis for a 4 night stay, half board. 
Upon arrival, our bags got taken from up and said they would be put in our room upon check in time. 
We checked in and were given Waterpark tickets as we couldn’t enter our room until 15:00. Check in was pretty smooth and was given refreshments. 

When we could check in, our room keys were handed over to us and yes, our luggage was in the room ready and waiting. I had paid for an arrangement to be done as it was my partners birthday. ‘Happy Birthday’ was on the bed in rose petals, with a towel animal which was the cutest, with a cake and card! This was so pretty. 

Our room was amazing. Looked over the aquarium, Atlantis Royale, Atlantis Balloon, in the skyline you could see the Burj Al Arab and Burj Khalifa, it was perfect. 
The room itself was amazing. Big comfy bed and pillows. Lots of storage. TV, mini bar, iron, safe. Big bathroom with free standing bath and amenities. 
The perfect touch was we were turned down every night, slippers at the side of the bed. Glass and water on the bedside table. Pillows and duvet ready. We were even given little gems to go on our chargers. And they tied up the bathroom.

With the hotel stay you get the aquarium tickets included, the aquarium is amazing. Lots of different fish and more to see. Rheymaria at the aquarium spoke to us reguarding a few of the animals which were in the aquarium, showing us skeletons and pieces of the animal, which we could touch and hold. She really made the time to speak to us. 

There are many dining options to choose from night. Whether you choose the buffet option, half board dining option which included a 3 course meal including soft drink or you could pay a supplement charge for some restaurant. We did a mixture of all 3 over our stay. 
Definitely recommend Seafire for a romantic steak night. En Fuego is amazing for its atmosphere and the decorations inside. This is South American themed. 
We also visited The Shore for a tex mex theme, this was one of our favourites. 
We liked to eat at Saffron for breakfast. It was light and airy. Had a nice feel to it. 

A few bars to drink at in the evening. We visited Arabian Terrace, this was a lovely, quiet vibe. 

There is also a cafe located on the G floor of the hotel which sells pastries and sandwiches, with a view of the aquarium. 
If you like a milkshake and ice cream, head to Cold Stone. The milkshakes are unreal!!!

The beach and pool are both amazing. Lots of sun beds at  both, with a towel ready on your bed. You can order food and drink on the app or press the buzzer and the waiter/waitress will take your order from the bed. There are many water fountains located at the beach, pool and water park. 
Watersports are available. Unfortunately it was too hot for us and we didn’t make use of this.

The water park is just amazing. Lockers and towel are available, lockers at a small charge should you wish to rent one. Aqua socks come as complimentary. Photographers around the pools and slides to capture special moments. There is a golf cart which goes around the park if you get too hot walking. Lots of food outlets. 

Lots of shops on site. From designer brands to food and keep sakes. There is a little market also on the ground floor for keepsakes, perfume/aftershave. Jewellery. 

The monorail can be reached from the hotel. It was really cheap for us to get to the Nakheel Mall and they run every 10-15 minutes. You also get good views of the palm whilst onboard. 

We got engaged whilst out in Dubai, and the hotel was amazing.
We were given a box with chocolate strawberries, macaroons and chocolates in the room with a cake.  
Each restaurant we went to they celebrated our engagement with a cake. They really make it special for us. 

I would go back tomorrow if I could. It was the most amazing experience which I didn’t want to end. I hope to be back in the future. 

Thank you Atlantis The Palm","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/b9/a9/2b/caption.jpg

My son is at an age where he's too old for kids club and won't relax on the beach for long so we finally took the plunge with the water park in mind and booked Atlantis for the October half term. We travelled as a family of 4 and took the overnight flight from the UK which arrived early in the day. Check-in was good and a room was immediately ready. This was good although we did need to pay for breakfast that morning. We had booked on a HB basis. Rooms exceeded expectations. I imagined that they may look dated considering the age of the hotel but I couldn't have been more wrong. The Deluxe/standard room was easily big enough and felt luxurious. We ate breakfast in Saffron each morning which we felt was much nicer than the other buffet restaurant. We tried the Lebanese and Mexican restaurants then also tried Saffron a couple of times at night. They were all superb and I feel that the dining options and quality of food and service rivals that of the Jumeirah - Madinat dine around. The two huge swimming pools were never over crowded. My son enjoyed playing water basketball each day and obviously, access to the waterpark was a huge hit. The new section of the park which connects the residents of The Royal is called Tridents Tower. It has all the latest slides and family rides and is great fun (even for someone who doesn't normally like water parks!) The early access to the park is a big bonus as it gets very busy with non-resident guests as the day goes on. We enjoyed hanging out and around the hotel in the evening, looking in the shops and staring at the aquarium for ages. The gym is good but my only criticism of the hotel is that the gym could be a lot bigger with more equipment. Free weights in particular. It did get very busy in the mornings. I think that considering it would cost a family of 4, £300 waterpark entry and £150 lost chambers aquarium entry, considering all - A stay at Atlantis is good value for money. Its great fun too! Location is really good. Easy to get on and off the Palm and the monorail connect the hotel - 1 stop away to the Nakheel mall which is also worth a visit. Especially the tower. 
If you're considering a stay at Atlantis - go for it. You won't be disappointed.","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-11-04","2024-11-04","en","Atlantis The Palm","1022759","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d1022759-r978686197-Atlantis_The_Palm-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"
