However, The room prices were so completey out of sync with the quality of room, view and overall hotel experience. Our view was partially blocked by overgrown trees . The people in reception were nice but our dinner server for both nights,Pina, was unknowledgeable about the menu and really couldn’t be bothered with the details. She didn’t even try to give us the actual name of one of the dishes she said “it’s just some frenchy thing” 
The dinner food was barely okay - not nearly worthy of the hefty price tag   
The lunch was inedible - I’ll tell you how you can mess up a burger…. Smother it top and bottom with an unidentifiable sauce ! And ruin a simple chicken wrap the same way 
The golf shop service was medium and our caddie was terrible - snotty and just wasn’t trying to help like a caddie should . Tiny gym, tiny spa, small outdoor pool ( with a gorgeous view ) Since our visit, we’ve been to two other golf properties in NZ ….at 1/3 of the cost we enjoyed far better overall experiences. Will advise everyone to skip this resort","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/8b/f2/98/caption.jpg","COUPLES","2024-03-31","2024-03-02","2024-03-02","en","Rosewood Kauri Cliffs","304269","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1911855-d304269-r940612562-Rosewood_Kauri_Cliffs-Matauri_Bay_Northland_Region_North_Island.html"

The views from almost every hole rival any golf course in the world….and I don’t even play golf! 

The linens are like sleeping on a cloud. There are real Silver ferns on property so I finally got to see one! 

Having a golf cart to tool around in is a great benefit. ","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/12/ec/8a/caption.jpg

On the last day we went to pick it up and it was missing 500 dollars. We spoke to management, but so far we have not heard back from the hotel.","0","","BUSINESS","2024-02-29","2024-02-16","2024-02-16","en","Rosewood Kauri Cliffs","304269","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1911855-d304269-r938507601-Rosewood_Kauri_Cliffs-Matauri_Bay_Northland_Region_North_Island.html"

by Rosewood and are going thru some major changes that unfortunately are not
positive.

Last year they offered a really fun Summer series which was a different activity
everyday.  They had a putting contest, wine tasting and a pickleball clinic when we
were there.  They eliminated this.  

Last year each night they had a different menu and the food was very good.  Now
the menu was the same each night and the food was mediocre and service
was very slow.

Add to that a total lack of amenities in the cottage and I think Rosewood should
carefully consider what they are eliminating.

Golf was great and the staff is still very helpful and most accommodating.","1","","COUPLES","2024-02-29","2024-02-15","2024-02-15","en","Rosewood Kauri Cliffs","304269","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1911855-d304269-r938446669-Rosewood_Kauri_Cliffs-Matauri_Bay_Northland_Region_North_Island.html"

Service: 5","Poor value proposition ","For $5800 per night we certainly expected more than was delivered. We had just arrived after 3 nights from their competition in Russell which way over delivered at a third the price. 

The room:  we booked a two bedroom unit with the understanding we would be upgraded. Well, it turns out we had already booked the highest category and    they couldn’t upgrade to next level because it was full of employees of the new company Rosewood that is taking over. 

The layout was poorly designed. To get to the primary bathroom from the primary bedroom you had to exit the bedroom and go through the common hallway. Who thought that was a good idea?

I bent down to tie my shoe on our third day and saw a belt sticking out from under the bed. It didn’t belong to us. Which means for three days at least the house keeping staff had missed it. Gross. 

There were only three towels in the bathroom so when you get caught in a rain storm and need to dry off (we did) there weren’t towels to use for showering with after. 

The food: so bad our first night that instead of going back to the property for lunch after our excursion we looked around for any alternative.  We didn’t find anything so had lunch at Kauri Cliffs and it was reasonable. Dinner that night was significantly better than the first night. 

The service:  everyone seemed to be trying hard but with the exception of the true professionals like Sebastian (food and beverage manager) and James (guest services) they really didn’t get what five star service should be. 

In summary: beautiful property with potential but wildly overpriced for what you currently get particularly when you compare to the alternatives in the area.

We were blown away at how amazing the property was and how personable the staff was.   The golf was first class.   We would highly recommend this property to anyone who truly needs some relaxation while taking in the views, private beaches, and the 6000 acres of private land the lodge has to explore.  This was the highlight of our 12 day trip.

The service, views, food, golf, our room, the relaxed environment - everything was incredible.  The staff are so friendly and super-accommodating and make you feel like family.  The golf course was the most picturesque I have played.  Also - because the course doesn't receive a lot of play, you feel like you have the entire course to yourself which was a nice bonus.  It was a special occasion destination for us and it did not disappoint in the least.  We will be talking about our experience there for a long time!","0","","COUPLES","2023-03-31","2023-03-28","2023-03-28","en","Rosewood Kauri Cliffs","304269","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1911855-d304269-r883903480-Rosewood_Kauri_Cliffs-Matauri_Bay_Northland_Region_North_Island.html"
