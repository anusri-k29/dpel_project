メディテラネオ(Mediterraneo)の
ブッフェディナー利用。時間フリー。
ドレスコード、スマートカジュアル。
スマートカジュアル=綺麗めカジュアル。
スニーカー、デニムは、NG。
せっかくなのでドレスアップしました。
ドバイファウンテンと夜景を堪能しながらのディナーが出来ました。
テラス席からのファウンテンは、全体的に見れてすごく良かったです♪
お料理は、前菜エリア、メインエリア、デザートエリアに分かれてるので取りやすくどれも美味しく頂きました♪
スタッフの接客、特にレセプションのrami。雰囲気、清潔感、ローケーション。
全てにおいて非常に良かったです。
素敵な夜を過ごすことが出来ました。
また、素直に利用したいと感じました。
rami、私を助けてくれてありがとうございました。","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2e/08/31/81/caption.jpg

The only thing that lets the hotel down is checking in and out.  They leave people waiting whilst they go and show another guest to their room and totally unattended on the front desk.  If they could sort this they would be offering the perfect service. Breakfast was lovely and a lot of choice.  Would highly recommend","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-28","2024-10-28","en","Armani Hotel","1777624","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d1777624-r976983088-Armani_Hotel-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

Our stay at the Armani Hotel in Dubai was nothing short of magical, but what truly made it stand out was the incredible kindness and compassion we received from one remarkable individual—Rami. He wasn’t just a staff member; he became a beacon of support and care for my family during a time we needed it the most.

While we were staying at the hotel, we unexpectedly fell ill. Rami’s immediate and heartfelt response to our situation was beyond anything we could have imagined. He didn’t just help us with routine hospitality—he treated us like family, perhaps even better than family. From the moment he realized we were unwell, he made it his personal mission to ensure our comfort and recovery.

Rami arranged a late check-out so we could rest as long as we needed, gave us breakfast to ensure we had nourishment, and kept checking in on us as if we were his own. When we needed medical help, Rami swiftly arranged for a doctor to visit our room. Not only that, but he personally saw to it that our prescriptions were delivered directly to us from the pharmacy. His attention to detail, care, and genuine concern turned what could have been a stressful time into one of comfort and reassurance.

Rami’s kindness went far beyond professionalism. He was warm, attentive, and truly empathetic—qualities that are hard to come by. His presence alone made us feel safe and cared for, and he left an indelible mark on our hearts. It’s not often that you meet someone in hospitality who feels like a lifelong friend, but Rami is exactly that kind of person.

While the Armani Hotel is a stunning testament to luxury and elegance, it’s the people, especially Rami, who make it a home away from home. He didn’t just meet expectations; he exceeded them in ways we couldn’t have imagined. If there’s one thing we will always remember from our time in Dubai, it’s the generosity and kindness of Rami.

We will forever be grateful for his compassion during our stay and will return to the Armani Hotel not just for its beauty, but for the wonderful people like him who make it truly exceptional.

I’ve traveled all over the world, have never experienced this type of hospitality. God bless Rami and the Armani hotel! 100 out of 10 stars !","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-16","2024-10-16","en","Armani Hotel","1777624","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d1777624-r974118277-Armani_Hotel-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

The hotel is in a good,  location, cozy hotel.
The staff was friendly , and special thanks to the Mr. Pramod kumar who upgraded my room to a suite with a fountain view, and also thanks to Mr. Anwesh. 
The room (suite) was very ordinary; the amenities are below average; they were better in Milan! there was no iron in the room, and I expected it to be more impressive.
I loved the relaxant smell of the place.
The hotel has direct access to Dubai Mall. 
The breakfast was wonderful and delicious.
The hotel price is very high. Overall, it’s a nice hotel, and I might stay there again if the price were lower.","0","","SOLO","2024-09-30","2024-09-22","2024-09-22","en","Armani Hotel","1777624","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d1777624-r970906215-Armani_Hotel-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"
