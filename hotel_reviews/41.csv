A shout out to the staff, who were above and beyond in the courtesy department, efficient, and oh, so helpful!  Special thanks to Ricardo Esteves, Antonio, Greg, Ivan, Shannon, Lukasz, and Tatiana at the breakfast restaurant, as well as the other staff in the restaurant.  Everyone in the hotel attended to our every need with kindness and efficiency.  Location was centrally located.","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-11-05","2024-11-05","en","The Bloomsbury Hotel","209229","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d209229-r978792044-The_Bloomsbury_Hotel-London_England.html"

Everyone from the moment that I exited the car to when I entered another to leave was so very friendly, helpful, kind and even fun!  Dale, the concierge answered all of my questions and made some wonderful recommendations.  The beautiful young woman at the registration desk (shame on me for forgetting her name), was sweet, helpful and a joy to see on almost a daily basis.  Peter from the moment that I stepped foot onto Bloomsbury grounds to the night before I left was kind, informative, and exceeded that which I expected with regards to directions, information etc.  Tony was a joy with who to speak, lots of knowledge information and fun.  And there was an older man with glasses who was very kind as well as a younger man who made my day whenever I saw him with his big smile and greeting of ""good morning.""  This staff is not one of a 4 star hotel, but that of a 10 stars if such thing existed.  Exceptional!  The hotel itself was very nice and clean. .. not fancy like the Ritz, so if that is what you want, then don't book, but it is quaint, lovely, well decorated and clean.  The rooms are a nice size.  I love that they had a kettle and Nespresso machine, so I was able to have tea and night to warm me up a bit from the damp cold as well as coffee in the morning.  Nice selection of teas and always leaving cookies!  The housekeeping staff kept my room clean.  The bed was so comfortable with nice, white crisp clean sheets.  The only issues I had were 1: the heating/cooling system can be confusing until you learn how to use it 2. until the day that I left, I could not figure out the lighting system-- so many switches and I don
t know which worked what, except for the restroom and the little ones beside the bed 3. the outlet in the bathroom had only 2 prongs instead of 3, whereby I had to used the hairdryer in the room.  It was very quiet for the most part: I hardly heard any police sirens and only heard one neighbor talking, but she had a naturally loud voice as I learned on the elevator!   I ate breakfast only one morning, and realized that it wasn't worth the money for me as I am a tiny eater in the morning.  But they did have a nice selection and the food was very good, but I preferred to go the creperie around the corner every evening to pick up a croissant, which is plenty for me in the morning.  The bar area is upscale, beautiful and very popular... every night it was quite full, but there are seats.  Evidently, locals enjoy it as well as patrons.  But the noise did not transfer into the rooms. The location is excellent: tube is essentially one block away, theater district 15 minutes walk, Westminster Abbey, Parliament etc., 20 minutes (I am a faster walker, so 25 for some), Piccadilly 15 minutes, British museum 3-5 minute walk.  Essentially there is much to see within a short walking distance and the tube is right there.  Overall, I cannot say enough about the Bloomsbury!  I recommend this hotel to anyone who appreciates extraordinary service, comfort, cleanliness and a optimal location.  And thank you to all of those who work there who made my trip so delightful!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/c0/3c/64/caption.jpg","SOLO","2024-10-31","2024-10-10","2024-10-10","en","The Bloomsbury Hotel","209229","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d209229-r973342747-The_Bloomsbury_Hotel-London_England.html"

The service, which is impeccably professional, is warm and personal. That is not an easy balance to strike.

The last time I stayed at this hotel was about 10 years ago, then I remember it as a good experience but now reality surpassed the memories. Oh, great!
Extra much credit to the nice lady and her team who were responsible for the breakfast, I think her name was Maria pch her team consisted of Estelita, Aga, Patricia, Mariel and Lazlo (5 out of 5 stars). Looking forward to coming back to The Bloomsbury.","0","","BUSINESS","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","en","The Bloomsbury Hotel","209229","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d209229-r978183570-The_Bloomsbury_Hotel-London_England.html"

Everything is excellent about it, the stylish decor, delicious food, spacious rooms etc, but the best thing about it is the staff. From the immaculate receptionists to the waitresses in the Dalloway, they all make you so welcome. I had not been to the hotel for nearly a year, but Brian, the concierge asked after my sister, who was with me previously and Maria, the breakfast manageress, still remembered just what I eat for breakfast. It is attention to detail like this and the warmth the staff exude which makes the hotel so exceptional. The food was even better than last time, the roast beef was superb and much more than I could eat. After one night at the Bloomsbury I felt really pampered. It was like coming home, even when you are in the middle of a bustling city.","0","","SOLO","2024-10-31","2024-10-30","2024-10-30","en","The Bloomsbury Hotel","209229","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d209229-r978051371-The_Bloomsbury_Hotel-London_England.html"

Loved everything about the hotel. Rooms were nicely appointed. We were beside the lift which was a little noisy but only because I am an extremely light sleeper. 
Breakfast was excellent with a varied menu something for every taste. 
The Coral room is lovely to relax in after a day out in the hustle and bustle of London. 
But what sets this hotel apart is the staff. I’ve never come across such professional, happy and accommodating staff. Every person we encountered was pleasant and friendly. Really made us feel welcome. From the doorman to the breakfast staff to the lovely turn down lady each and everyone is a credit to the Doyle Group. 
We will definitely be back. 
The Bloomsbury is so far ahead of the Kensington in how it treats guests. 
Really was a weekend to remember.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-30","2024-10-30","en","The Bloomsbury Hotel","209229","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d209229-r978019270-The_Bloomsbury_Hotel-London_England.html"

A warm welcome, the room ready before time with small macaroons welcome on the nightstand, quiet nights, tea, coffee, biscuits very regularly replenished in the room, soft and clean towels, a bathrobe and soft slippers...
The staff is concerned about the well-being of guests and keeps smiling.
Many thanks to Maria, Estélita, Tania, Gabriela, Aga and Patricia for sumptuous breakfasts and for their kindness.
The hotel is conveniently located with the West End theatres, the British museum and the underground next door.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/f0/c7/ee/caption.jpg

Every aspect of it was top notch. The rooms and common areas are warm and traditional English. It has a beautiful sitting area with a fireplace, a gorgeous restaurant bar, the high tea patio is so pretty. The people who work here go ABOVE and beyond for their guests. They all know who you are after the first day. Antonio, Ivan, Eva, and Ricardo are exceptional people. I travel far and wide and worked many years in the travel industry, this is a real find and true gem of a place. Location is perfect too. Easy walking distance to Leicester square, covent gardens, all west end shows (go see Devil wears Prada - it’s incredible and right next door!). I will DEFINITELY be back! Book it!
