Our maid Alpana did a great job  keeping our room clean, thank you.","We arrived for a wedding and the hotel was a perfect base. The staff were very friendly, attentive but not overbearing and accommodated requests promptly and fully. 
The hotel is showing its age in some public areas but our room was spotless. No doubt all the maids are excellent but ours Alpana especially so. 
We eat breakfast and evenings from the buffet and it has a very good selection of meals to suit from whatever continent you come from. 
My daughter had been living off Huel meals because she has a very severe nut allergy and also chooses to be vegan! They did, according to her a fantastic Vegan burger and she is alive to recommend it so they were careful with nuts too. 
I think it was cheaply priced for what we got.","6","","COUPLES","2024-02-29","2024-02-04","2024-02-04","en","Hilton Jaipur","6540893","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d6540893-r936819179-Hilton_Jaipur-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html"

The moment we stepped into the elegant lobby, we were welcomed warmly by the attentive staff. Sandeep, the General Manager, and his team went above and beyond to ensure our experience was memorable.

We celebrated birthdays on the rooftop, where we enjoyed an incredible view of the full moon—a truly magical setting. Breakfast was a highlight, with one of the best buffets I’ve encountered globally. The rooms were spacious, comfortable, and thoughtfully arranged.

The staff’s attention to detail made our celebration extra special. Knowing we were there for birthdays and an anniversary, they surprised us with delicious treats and decorated our bed with a “Happy Anniversary” banner and towel swans—a lovely touch!

I highly recommend the Hilton Jaipur for its outstanding service, beautiful views, and delicious food. Jaipur itself stole our hearts! This city, filled with rich history and vibrant sights, quickly became my favorite in India. We can’t wait to return!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/e7/c1/31/caption.jpg

From the moment we stepped out of the car at the front door, we felt taken care of. The security personnel, door persons, bellboys, reception staff, room service staff, and restaurant staff were all very kind and hospitable to us. Housekeeping did a great job making our room in between our sightseeing outings. The staff at Aurum (restaurant) took really good care of us across our various meals, and special shoutout to Kakan for ensuring multiple times at every meal that we had everything we needed. The food was spot on, thanks to the chef and kitchen staff. I recommend including your meals in your room reservation.","1","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-20","2024-10-20","en","Hilton Jaipur","6540893","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304555-d6540893-r974641358-Hilton_Jaipur-Jaipur_Jaipur_District_Rajasthan.html"
