We used bookings.com and shortly after submitting the hotel called us directly to confirm and ask what they could do to make our stay more enjoyable. They kindly gave us a late checkout, booked restaurants for us. 
Breakfast was really nice, unlimited barrister coffee and exceptional service. We also had lunch in the ITL where breakfast is served. Pizzas are amazing from the pizza ovens. Unfortunately we had a poor experience in ‘The Kitchen’ restaurant when we had lunch on our final day. Service was combative when we gave the manager feedback on the quality of their crab leg. 
Other than ‘The Kitchen’ we could not fault this hotel. Staff were just outstanding. Thank you EOS","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-19","2024-10-18","en","Eos By SkyCity","20966504","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255093-d20966504-r974474855-Eos_By_SkyCity-Adelaide_Greater_Adelaide_South_Australia.html"

But aside from the amazing service they provide they are also incredibly kind. Particualrly Mr Pranav Dodeja who remembered us from checking in the night before in our wedding dress and tuxedo. Knowing it was our honeymoon they offered us a complimentary sparkling wine and the most amazing room possible to make our time feel extra special. 
The river view of Adelaide is simply incredible, having lived here my entire life I'd never seen these sweeping views before, which highlight just how stunning this city is. As for our room we couldn't be happier,it's super clean and feels ultra luxurious with modern colours, king bed, automatic curtains and very spacious bathroom, you will feel really luxe staying here even if only for a night.
I am so so grateful we booked with Eos on a whim; which was a very last minute decision but the 24/7 option to check in made everything so convenient and we certainly don't regret a single moment of our time there. We will definitely be back for our anniversary in a year's time.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/a9/75/6b/caption.jpg

They are always checking on you and asking if there is something they can do to help you in any way.
They will walk with you to places you want to go, they will bring you things.

2) The rooms are top notch 
3) The spa has luxurious treatments
4) I love staying at the hotel when I go to the spa - you just roll up to your hotel room and continue to relax. 
5) The only thing bad about the hotel is the in room dining service charge of $10.","0","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-09-07","2024-09-07","en","Eos By SkyCity","20966504","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255093-d20966504-r968678051-Eos_By_SkyCity-Adelaide_Greater_Adelaide_South_Australia.html"

My wife even had some calculated luck to win $650 at the casino, we are not gamblers! Even the hairdryer is of excellent quality. The staff are set to make the stay a pleasure and rememberable!

Would highly recommend a river view room (I think these cost more than the standard room but the view is totally worth it)

Service is fantastic and check in quick and efficient.

Room service food is excellent, well priced with generous portions.

The gym is incredible with the latest technogym equipment, pool is small more like a lap pool but still nice to hang around.

Would highly recommend if looking for a hotel in Adelaide","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2c/34/c6/cb/caption.jpg

As such, our flight got in early meaning our arrival at the EOS was at 07:30 hrs for a check in for 15:00hrs. After in excess of 24 hrs of travelling we were greeted to a warm and friendly welcome from Alisha. We weren’t at all expecting that our room would be ready, but were hoping for a shower and a bar to sit in at the very least to freshen ourselves up. However, Alisha and the back room team went out of their way and made our room ready for 10:00 hrs and invited us to use the spa until that time. From the bottom of or weary hearts. Thank you.
Her excellent service maintained recommending an excellent French coffee shop and marked out locations that we might fancy visiting.
Room, really clean and smart.
They recognised our ten year anniversary with a delightful bottle of red which was a very nice touch.
Pool and spa humble, but, not too busy.
The sky bar is great to watch the sun go down with a cocktail and they even accommodated a Mai Thai which wasn’t on the menu.
Thank you for the experience.","0","","COUPLES","2024-04-30","2024-04-28","2024-04-28","en","Eos By SkyCity","20966504","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255093-d20966504-r948672789-Eos_By_SkyCity-Adelaide_Greater_Adelaide_South_Australia.html"
