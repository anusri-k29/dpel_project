Handy for V & A and DCA and the Dundee Rep theatre. Had a very pleasant stay and would come back again.","0","","COUPLES","2024-11-30","2024-11-05","2024-11-05","en","Best Western Queen's Hotel","192363","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186518-d192363-r978815013-Best_Western_Queen_s_Hotel-Dundee_Scotland.html"

We spoke to Kim and another person on reception (had cool hair) and it was listened to We got given another room (much bigger size ) and free dinner on the sat (sadly dinner was still not great but the girl serving unlike on the Fri was very nice and kind so it didn't matter as much due to this. 

The fri had karaoke and was a great laugh and staff outwith the one mentioned were lovely 😍  
The hotel is dated but I liked its character and didn't expect 5*

Although we had a few issues they were dealt with proffesionaly and promt so will be back again. If they sort food service and quality of food could be a good place to eat.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-18","2024-10-18","en","Best Western Queen's Hotel","192363","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186518-d192363-r974397085-Best_Western_Queen_s_Hotel-Dundee_Scotland.html"

The room was small and compact which is typical for value, but everything felt worn out and old. I'm sure this hotel was lovely and grand in it's time but it's definitely not now and that gives it a sad atmosphere.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-14","2024-10-14","en","Best Western Queen's Hotel","192363","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186518-d192363-r973851189-Best_Western_Queen_s_Hotel-Dundee_Scotland.html"

If there are any would be visitors to Dundee, you could do a lot worse than book this historic hotel, in a great location for shopping, drinks, etc and an easy 10 minute stroll from train station..Rooms are clean the beds super comfy, the breakfast has enough for the biggest appetite, and the staff are just so down to earth and friendly.  I will be back for sure ( again).

My room on the 4th floor had a good view. The room was small, it had a bath and shower, the bath was small for me, but still nice. The room was clean, the bed was hard but the sleep quality was good. The car park was secure, and free, remember to put your registration into the pad by the reception. The breakfast was good, instead of a full Scottish, we went for the Arbroath Smokie, a lightly smoked Haddock, served with eggs how you prefer, never had it before, but it was absolutely delicious. Old school hotel, getting a new lick of paint as we stayed there. The staff were very nice and I had an enjoyable stay. ","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/28/5e/d1/caption.jpg

So little space between heater on the wall and bed that you had to move in crab fashion whereupon I got a gash on my leg from a sharp screw sticking out from the side of the bed. Booked early at mid price. Staff were lovely but that’s all.","0","","COUPLES","2024-07-31","2024-07-07","2024-07-07","en","Best Western Queen's Hotel","192363","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186518-d192363-r958472612-Best_Western_Queen_s_Hotel-Dundee_Scotland.html"
