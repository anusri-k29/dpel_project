My children loved the pool and the kids club.

I loved the cleanliness and friendly staff.  Nothing is too much trouble.  Special mentions should go to Maria (front of house), Saniya and Jannick (hospitality team) who were fantastic with my children and made us feel very welcome and Chef Naushad and Chef Pritvi who patiently helped us on a daily basis with my daughter's severe nut allergy. Thank you guys!

Please be aware that the on-site shop is primarily for souvenir shopping and is not grocery store (as mentioned in some descriptions).","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-29","2024-10-29","en","Hilton Mauritius Resort & Spa","299624","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298343-d299624-r977136407-Hilton_Mauritius_Resort_Spa-Flic_En_Flac.html"

In particular, the garden is a gem with diverse plants. Some areas seemed redone and plants need further growth, but the area with established trees and flowers are so nicely designed and the pond linked with the pool area is lovely.

The Flic en Flac beach itself is picturesque. The sea is shallow for swimming or snorkeling, so it’s important to check and wait for the high tide. This long beach was better for a hike. For swimming, we mostly used the pool. The adult pool is beautiful and calm. There are plenty of beach chairs on the beach and around the swimming pools.

All restaurants and bars look posh and provide foods and drinks of high quality at reasonable prices. The hotel offered a variety of live music and performances for lunch time and evening entertainment. I particularly loved to listening to lovely songs mixed with the sound of waves at the bar next to Les Coquillages. 

The spa is under reconstruction so sauna and steam room are not expected to be around until end of December 2023. Massages were available in two designated guest rooms with massage beds or on the beach. I preferred the  one on the beach. 

Staff members were welcoming,  friendly and helpful. 

There are wild life such as lizards, birds, frogs and cats. Don’t get scared by the frog chorus in the evening. Unlike European ones, they stop singing around midnight. And according to our search they help controlling mosquitoes. On rainy days and in the evening, baby frogs can hop around, so mind your steps.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2a/cf/ef/a6/caption.jpg

The staff comes back to the room at the end of the day to ask if you need anything.. (great attention). Breakfasts always very complete - 4 restaurants available (3 on reservation) A large selection. Hotel always very clean, very nice pools and superb little waterfalls.

We were repeatedly ignored and not served at the beach bar, although the bar was almost empty and there were enough staff. Long waits for food and drink at the beach bar. Food in the buffet restaurant not exactly varied. Every day almost the same buffet with only minor changes, although the buffet has a different theme every day. Chairs and loungers dirty with bird droppings and it is not cleaned. Drinks ordered without ice, but served several times with ice. Teapot was served, but without cup. Latte macchiato was served in a tall glass, but with a short spoon, the ordered latte macchiato for breakfast was a different coffee every day, etc. Although complaining at a high level, everything should not be at a 5 star hotel and the travel price. Otherwise beautiful grounds for a relaxing holiday. Maid Malini of Suite 1002 was very nice and friendly.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-29","2024-10-29","en","Hilton Mauritius Resort & Spa","299624","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298343-d299624-r977118071-Hilton_Mauritius_Resort_Spa-Flic_En_Flac.html"

I was informed that I could only eat at the restaurant and that all other amenities, including the kids' club, were off-limits because the hotel was full. Strangely, when I went to see the kids' club, it was completely empty. I thought it would be okay to let my children enjoy the space for a moment. Management thought it wise to tell us to leave citing “policy” as the reason.

Given that the kids' club was empty, they could have been more accommodating. The unwelcoming attitude and rigid approach made the experience anything but relaxing. I usually don’t leave reviews, but this visit left me so displeased I felt compelled to share.","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-27","2024-10-27","en","Hilton Mauritius Resort & Spa","299624","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298343-d299624-r976819464-Hilton_Mauritius_Resort_Spa-Flic_En_Flac.html"

The rooms are spacious with all you need and balconies. The balconies do vary from room to room, some are covered, others are open and some are a bit of a mix! They do need to spend a bit of time checking the maintenance of the rooms, the light system seems overly complex and doesn't work all that well, some switches are loose, one party in our group couldn't turn a bedside light off without turning off all the lights for example. Our room had a loose toilet seat and the shower amenities fell off the wall.
The rest of the resort was fantastic, pools were lovely plenty of bars, deck chairs did get busy around the pools but there were always some on the beach. The beach was very clean and super clear water in the lagoon for snorkeling. There were water sport activities including sailing, paddle boards wind surfing and pedalos. You could also borrow reef shoes, fins and snorkels (although they were full face snorkels that have been shown to be dangerous and you shouldn't dive under the water with).
We did have one meal at the beach front restaurant which we weren't that impressed with, food didn't come out together, wasn't hot and some portions were very small. The hotel can help with taxis into the town were there are loads of options or you can walk down the beach about 30mins, be warned it might be hard to get a taxi back at night though! 
Breakfast was a good spread with plenty of options, my wife wasn't a fan of the machine coffee served so you can ask the staff for a proper coffee from the barrister upstairs.
Would certainly stay here again should the opportunity arise and could maybe try the Indian or Thai restaurants.","0","","FAMILY","2024-09-30","2024-10-25","2024-10-25","en","Hilton Mauritius Resort & Spa","299624","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298343-d299624-r976638472-Hilton_Mauritius_Resort_Spa-Flic_En_Flac.html"

Delicious meals, even the buffet is upscale. The staff is highly considerate, welcoming and exceptionally kind. A special thank you to Jannick, working in the various restaurants, for his particularly warm welcome, his kind words and his unwavering smile. The only small downside is that the mattresses of the deckchairs are soiled by birds and it is a bit disgusting to put the bath towels on them. Otherwise, we will definitely return to this establishment.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-22","2024-10-22","en","Hilton Mauritius Resort & Spa","299624","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g298343-d299624-r974933577-Hilton_Mauritius_Resort_Spa-Flic_En_Flac.html"

We stayed at the Hilton as a family, and I have to commend the management and the team for their ability to maintain excellent service levels everywhere. 

From the second you walk in, you are warmly greeted, slowly being ushered into what will be a worry free stay. 

We spent a couple days at the Hilton, food was always good and selection was ample. Touch you have to book the specialty restaurants in advance for dinner, we were always able to get our choice within 24 hours. 

The facilities were great. As I understand it, the hotel seems to have undergone a renovation program during COVID. As such, everything seems relatively new, and most importantly, enriching just works. 

The location worked well for us as we were able to do quite a few activities all within in 25 minute drive. 

Thanks again to the whole Hilton team!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/ca/91/53/caption.jpg
