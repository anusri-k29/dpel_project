Our check-in was late i.e., post midnight, I  requested for a upgrade or lounge access but it was denied by Kaushal at reception desk. 

He didn't even bother to check on the system and straight away denied our request.

We already mentioned to make sure that we get room at non-smoking area however while entering our alloted room, We could sense unusual smell, which seems to be of nicotine or ciggerates.

Bedsheets had multiple black lines & spots which are easily visible.

Tiles inside room entrance were not clean & could see yellow patches.

While I was going outside to report issue at reception desk, I saw blue packet which seems to be garbage and it was kept just outside our door.

These things were noticable within 5 minutes of entering the room, which ensures that room was not prepared before alloting it to the guest.

Since we are vegetarians, We request few items to add in breakfast buffet, In all the Marriott properties, staff members were very kind and informed us to notify in advance so that requested items can be prepared by chef.

We did same at JW Juhu, I went all the way downstairs post midnight at the restaurant, requesting the same but our request was not entertained.

So, We requested again during our Breakfast but staff members were not at all cooperative, They didn't even  bother to check with chef and denied it.

Aman Chaurasiya from restaurant was very rude and unprofessional.

We raised these concerns with the restaurant manager Joseph but he was adamant and rigid. He was repeating same lines again and again without listening what we are trying to say. This is the first manager I encountered who has same behaviour like his staff members. 

Later in the afternoon, I spoke with Dushyant who was the duty manager at reception desk, He was sensible enough to listen our concerns and complaints. He acknowledged all our issues and said will escalate it to the Management Team.

Most of the staff members are not hospitable at all however people like Dushyant Singh (Duty Manager) are the ones who are really kind and generous. Seriously take care of the guests.

Dushyant later admitted that if upgrade was not possible then person who was working at the night shift could provided a better room.

Dushyant was very helpful, caring, cooperative, hospitable and supportive. 

He also given few benifits as a kind gesture to compensate the inconvenience caused during our stay.

Thank you so much Dushyant. 

People like Dushyant are not just a staff but an asset to the company.

He was humble, polite & courteous.

Heard all our issues.

A small feedback for the hotel layout, the overall look and design is not good enough if I compare to other JW Marriott properties such as Mumbai Sehar or St. Regis. 

Carpets were old, tiles were not clean, buttons on lift were broken. Overall building seems that it doesn't meet Marriott standards. Apart from that Pool, Beach access, Lobby, Lower lobby and washrooms were nice and clean. 
Gajendra Singh at lotus restaurant was also very helpful and courteuous.","0","","FRIENDS","2024-08-31","2024-11-03","2024-11-03","en","Jw Marriott Mumbai Juhu","299754","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d299754-r978566590-Jw_Marriott_Mumbai_Juhu-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html"

Breakfast can do better in term of the waiting services, food is delicious though. I really love the efficiency communication of front desk prior to arrival.

Concierges Noor, Luis and Abishek go above and beyond. Travel service representative Savio Mendonca gets better as the years go by! He even remembers I love chilled,freshly squeezed orange juice!!
Driver Sharath is the man if you need transport in and around Mumbai.
Also deserving of specific mention is head porterage/bell boy services Sachin and also another Sachin in Housekeeping/Mini-bar sevices","0","","BUSINESS","2024-10-31","2024-11-03","2024-11-03","en","Jw Marriott Mumbai Juhu","299754","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d299754-r978484771-Jw_Marriott_Mumbai_Juhu-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html"

Located in posh Juhu Beach, the hotel has spacious and modern facilities (esp gym/spa and executive lounge) and restaurants (incl Saffron, w/ m. chef A. Qureshi). The staff were hospitable and very attentive to our requests. Of note, concierge service provided by Mr. Noorulhaque Shaikh was especially appreciated.  Noor’s discerning suggestions for tourist sites, shopping and restaurants were complemented by his scheduling and communication of times and locations – all of which were very helpful.  JW Marriott Juhu is definitely my next stay in Mumbai.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/f4/a5/a5/caption.jpg","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","en","Jw Marriott Mumbai Juhu","299754","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d299754-r978165818-Jw_Marriott_Mumbai_Juhu-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html"

The rooms was perfect for both of us friends - lots of space, amazing sea view, huge bathroom - just could have done with more wardrobe space. 
We also had lounge access which was brilliant. That lounge staff were so attentive and professional. It was a great place to catch up on my work, relax and watch the beautiful sunset. 
The buffet breakfast each morning was the icing on the cake. The live musician to the variety and service was again 5 star. I just wish I had a bigger appetite. 
I can not wait to return with my family.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/f3/13/45/caption.jpg","FRIENDS","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","en","Jw Marriott Mumbai Juhu","299754","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d299754-r978110414-Jw_Marriott_Mumbai_Juhu-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html"
