Our bathroom had water leaking through the ceiling lights and extractor fan when we were trying to get ready in the morning. We have complained about this but have not had any response from the hotel, Very poor customer service,","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-11-04","2024-11-04","en","Radisson Blu Hotel, Edinburgh City Centre","189363","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186525-d189363-r978689864-Radisson_Blu_Hotel_Edinburgh_City_Centre-Edinburgh_Scotland.html"

Great location.

Lovely comfortable beds, fluffy towels and robes, shower was great, and fast delicious room service.

Just what you need for rest when exploring the city. Clean and comfortable accommodation.

A bit of city noise but not too bad for a Friday night and they supply ear plugs.","0","","COUPLES","2024-11-30","2024-11-03","2024-11-03","en","Radisson Blu Hotel, Edinburgh City Centre","189363","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186525-d189363-r978545293-Radisson_Blu_Hotel_Edinburgh_City_Centre-Edinburgh_Scotland.html"

They made a problem for us while we were checking in and checking out. While checking in we resolved the problem in our own way, but while checking out they wanted to charged us 100 pounds for being a few minutes late, even though I have been too many hotels and being a few minutes late while checking out never caused any problems. I do not recommend this hotel for anyone. Every person that I talked too during my stay was very rude and not welcoming at all.","0","","FAMILY","2024-11-30","2024-11-02","2024-11-02","en","Radisson Blu Hotel, Edinburgh City Centre","189363","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186525-d189363-r978377931-Radisson_Blu_Hotel_Edinburgh_City_Centre-Edinburgh_Scotland.html"

This particular hotel is situated in a great central location of the city so you can make the most important visits on foot. You walk the Royal Mile to the Castle and it is not far from the train station where there is also a bus stop leading to the airport. The rooms are spacious and comfortable although the decor is a bit dated. Very comfortable bed with double pillows and in the bathroom you will find the necessary for beard and shower: shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, razor, shaving cream and toothpaste with toothbrush.
We used from the lobby, with bar service, after Check-out until departure time. Very attentive and courteous staff.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/dc/24/63/caption.jpg
