We arrived at 3 am in the morning and were checked in very quickly and efficiently I was pleasantly surprised to be met by Mosharof Emad who remembered us from our last visit in 2019 who took our luggage and showed us to our room. Before we left we upgraded to the king alcove corner room  which also included breakfast and access to the executive club. After a good night’s sleep we enjoyed the buffet breakfast which had a great selection of food for every palette  we spent the day lazing about the pool area and beach. The executive club included afternoon tea from 3 till 5. (The scones were very nice )Then unlimited cocktails and beer with canapes from 5 30 pm till 7 30pm I would like to give a special mention to Thike,Lydia,April and Mheryl who looked after us very well every day we were in there    Our room was spectacular to say the least looking out over the beach and the Arabian gulf and at night the Ain Dubai with its light show. Our room was kept immaculate by Dipin (so thanks to him ) overall a very enjoyable experience at Hilton ","3","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2a/3c/b6/a8/caption.jpg

A special thanks to Lydia Fajardo at the executive lounge for making sure we got fed even though we missed breakfast that first day. She and the members of the executive lounge staff were fantastic throughout our stay, and we really felt taken care of.

Housekeeping was always punctual and attentive to our needs. Sunita made us feel right at home. Our room was nicely decorated for my birthday, and a cake was waiting when I returned. It was truly a lovely surprise. My son really loved the towel animals too.

We had a half-board booking and had all our meals at Oceana due to my partner’s gluten-free needs. The meals were plentiful, and the restaurant staff always made sure my partner had options. Special thanks to Chef Caleb for taking care of our needs and for the special surprise on my birthday! It was an unexpected but highly appreciated gesture.

My only negative would be about the size of the bathroom, which was small and didn’t have a bathtub. Regardless of this, we had a great time at this hotel and would love to stay there again.

Thank you to everyone who made our stay memorable!","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-11-05","2024-11-05","en","Hilton Dubai Jumeirah","306662","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d306662-r978774840-Hilton_Dubai_Jumeirah-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

The hotel had all you need and the location is amazing. 
It’s a little outdated, very much in need of an upgrade inside and it feels dark in the restaurant and surrounds. The rooms are tired as well. Outside is good and the beach area set out nicely. Noisy on the street side where we were and the sports car revving up at 11pm every night is incredibly annoying - not the hotels fault. 
The food was okay in Oceana, lots of variety and amazing puddings! I’d have liked higher quality and more for children but overall it was okay and catered for all nationalities. The other restaurants were great and we liked the option on our board basis to try them all. 
It was frustrating that you had to go down to the pool so early to get a space, but not sure how the hotel can better handle ignorant holidaymakers who reserved all the beds!
Our room attendant Janaka did a great job and the towel animals and children’s gift impressed our daughter. 
Esther in Oceana was a welcome smile each morning. In fact, all the wait staff were terrific and everyone great with the kids. 
Overall we enjoyed our stay, and the staff made it!","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-11-04","2024-11-04","en","Hilton Dubai Jumeirah","306662","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d306662-r978639169-Hilton_Dubai_Jumeirah-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

However the hotel is in a perfect location and the beach is amazing. The pool was virtually always in the shade so we did not use, also not many beds round pool for if your watching children.
Food was adequate, nothing to moan about but was not 4star, was basic and think we expected more. The limited set included menus also Downgraded the experience of eating in the restaurants as too restrictive. 
The deluxe partial sea view room was lovely- beautiful view, nice comfy huge bed, nice shower. Free water tea and coffee in room which was greatly appreciated and well restocked daily for us. The only niggle was it was 3 adults but the third bed was a fold away bed (which we knew beforehand) but would have expected an actual divan bed in the room for a 3rd adult in such a place as Dubai! 
Overall would recommend","0","","FAMILY","2024-11-30","2024-11-03","2024-11-03","en","Hilton Dubai Jumeirah","306662","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d306662-r978526395-Hilton_Dubai_Jumeirah-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"
