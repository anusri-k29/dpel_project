The service we received from security men, concierge and guest relations, to AER, breakfast  and OPUS restaurant staff, to our housekeeper to any staff we met in the corridors, was beyond five star. 

Everyone was was attentive to our needs and they wanted to make our stay even more excellent, even when they had already gone beyond this. The staff genuinely wanted to look after us, not just doing their job but really making us feel at home. My tummy is very sensitive, and I had been weary that I would not be able to eat the street foods, just in case I got ill. But that weary was soon dissolved by Mumbai FS chefs, as they cooked us different Indian dishes and Mumbai street foods. I feel I didn't miss out on anything and the plus is I enjoyed the food and did not get ill with the food. Despite being busy the Executive Chef made time to come and talk to us, its like they all telepathic knew that the way to my heart is through food:-) 

I had particularly gone to Mumbai FS to celebrate my birthday. Oh boy, the celebrations were beyond my wildest dreams! Just what I wanted and far above.

Although the hotel is undergoing some renovations, disruptions were minimised and solutions were found for the unavoidable, e.g the swimming pool is not functioning at the moment, so they linked up with another hotel for FS guests to go there and use the swimming pool. I had that experience as well, of going to the other hotel for swimming and I enjoyed it, because a car was provided to take me to and from, the staff from the other hotel were as pleasant as well.

I can't brag enough about FS Mumbai, but its worth the experience. I would recommend for people visiting Mumbai to taste this remarkable hotel, to see and feel this exquisite experience. Thank you FS Mumbai staff.","0","","FRIENDS","2024-10-31","2024-11-05","2024-11-05","en","Four Seasons Hotel Mumbai","672189","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d672189-r978786147-Four_Seasons_Hotel_Mumbai-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html"

It's home away from home for me.  The staff, location, rooms, and service are exceptional.

Mayank Yadav  and Fagun Singh, are exceptional.
They pay attention to every time detail.

Abhishek, their chef,  Alankar in their restaurant were all excellent.

No matter how busy they were, we  felt like we were the only ones there.

The fitness center, facility and staff are always accommodating and helpful.

The car services to and from the airport and while in the city were all just impeccable.
The airline lost my bags and the hotel went above and beyond to help me.

The app is superb and they also constantly communicate via WhatsApp.
I just can't say enough great things about them.
I'll definitely be back there soon","0","","BUSINESS","2024-10-31","2024-11-03","2024-11-03","en","Four Seasons Hotel Mumbai","672189","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d672189-r978577101-Four_Seasons_Hotel_Mumbai-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html"

What puts them in top 5 is the incredible staff who takes care of everything from the point you check in. The team lead by chef Abhishek prepares amazing food as per your dietary requirements. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel specially if you have any special needs as I believe staff will be able to cater for it (where practically possible).","1","","NONE","2024-10-31","2024-11-03","2024-11-03","en","Four Seasons Hotel Mumbai","672189","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d672189-r978566927-Four_Seasons_Hotel_Mumbai-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html"

Quality of rooms is at par with what you would expect out of a luxury hotel - spacious, convenient with a good decor. Ask for a room facing the sea - the view is quite serene. Breakfast service was excellent, with a wide range of options and caring staff.  Lobby of the hotel is a tad small, but did not add to any inconvenience as I was not hosting any guests at the lobby.","0","","BUSINESS","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","en","Four Seasons Hotel Mumbai","672189","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d672189-r978111224-Four_Seasons_Hotel_Mumbai-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html"

Please find below some feedback regarding my stay at the FS Mumbai from Sep 25-30, 2024. I am sorry this is a little late: I have been traveling. I have already filled out your online survey; here I wish to provide some further feedback.

I am a regular guest of your hotel since it first opened in 2008, and I normally stay in your hotel whenever I visit Mumbai.

The following staff provided outstanding service:

Kitchen - Chef Abhishek Gurav and Chef Kathiravan prepared customised orders for me every day during my five-night stay. The food was always fresh and delicious and according to my dietary preferences. Chef Jude Fernando and his team are doing a fantastic job. I found the breakfast buffet to be wonderful, food items were innovatively presented and there were every day some unexpected items on the buffet, such as the Gujarati specialties. You have a great kitchen team!

F&B Service - Alankar Mantri took great care of me during every meal at the 2nd floor restaurant. Amey Kudtarkar provided exceptional service every day.

IRD - Chetan and his team are doing an outstanding job of running IRD. Orders are always delivered on time, and they pay great attention to detail. They anticipate guest needs and often deliver delightful surprises. Sarvesh, Nayan, Gajanan, Pritesh, Harshal and Sudeshna all provided wonderful service.

Concierge - Fagun, Driver Rajesh Shetye

HK - Sabah and his team are doing a fantastic job of ensuring that my room is set up according to my preferences even before I check in, which saves time once I checkin. Vrushabh, Maaz, Gopikrishna did everything to make my stay memorable.

Aer Bar - Pranav, Vineeth Krishna, Eshwar, Kim, Adnan (service) and Adnan (bartender) provided great service.

Modernist - I had one meal and a drink at the Modernist, and it was a great experience. Chef Abhit made some very nice food for me, and Swayam and Sauraj took great care of me.

Engg. - Laxman, Mayuresh

Other feedabck and areas to improve:

1. I did face a problem two times with IRD orders. I ordered north Indian food with less oil and asked them not to put red chilly powder, but unfortunately the order was floating with oil and rich masalas. I was hungry and did not have time to reurn the order, so I ate it, which led me to have an upset stomach and affected my work for the day. I suggest your chefs be trained in how to prepare home-style food with less oil and no masala. Contrary to popular belief, Punjabi food is not about heavy gravies and intense spices. It's more about clean flavours and cooked in mustard oil with minimal spices. I have suggested to Chef Fernando that perhaps your chefs should have a session with Mumbai-based Punjabi Chef Sherry Mehta to learn about how to create home-style Punjabi food.

2. At Opus, I found the staff to be unresponsive to customer needs. I had sat down for a meeting and ordered a juice. The area under the table was very dirty with a sticky syrupy substance. I noticed my shoes had got stuck to the floor. I asked the restaurant staff for help three times, but no one helped me. I got the impression that there is no one in charge of that restaurant and that things are running pn autopilot--not a good situation! After this experience, I did not go back to Opus dirung the rest of my stay.

3. The newly-renovated Aer bar is very nice. The music the DJs play is good, but there are several tracks where the quality of the sound is not good, and it almost sounds like noise. Maybe some better tracks can be played.

4. This time at the spa, my expereince at the steam bath was not good. The steam was coming from the top, which made my head get overwhelmed with heat and I quickly exited the steam room. I feel that the steam should come form below the bench. Also, there was no way for the guest to control the temperature of the steam room.

5. I attended an IGCC conference meeting in your banquets and was shocked to see that you all are still using plastic water bottles. Request you to switch to glass bottles completely.

6. The toilet in my room, even after flushing, would keep running everyday, wasting a lot of water. Every day I would call Engineering and everyday they would fix it, but after some time it would start running again. Request you to have the problem fixed as it is a colossal waste of water.

It was overall a good experience to stay at your hotel again, and I am looking forward to my next trip.

Sincerely,

Ashish Mohan","0","","BUSINESS","2024-09-30","2024-10-21","2024-10-21","en","Four Seasons Hotel Mumbai","672189","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d672189-r974781049-Four_Seasons_Hotel_Mumbai-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html"
