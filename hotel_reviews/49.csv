Good location, nearby to the city's main attractions at the same time far from the hustle and bustle plus the continuous honking.  Its a child friendly hotel with a  modern shopping mall next-door.  Staff are friendly and accommodative.  
Rooms are well kept. We booked for the standard room, it's a bit small ( compared to other hotels) but very comfortable with all the necessary amenities.  Beds and pillows are soft and we had a good night's rest every day of our stay - ( which is very important)
A big shout to the front desk personnel Mr Rajat for his warm hospitality and smile. He accommodated our request and ensured our needs were met. He and his team - Ms Disha, Lakshay, Vishal , Harpreet and Mr Sagardeep were very kind and helpful throughout our stay.
To the welcoming team , at the hotel entrance- thank you for welcoming us with warm greetings and ensuring our safety.  
To the young gentleman- Mr Anspreet , thank you for your warm smile each time we entered and exited the hotel!
To the breakfast/ dining hall team, thank you for your services , Ms Dipali and  her team. Always serving us with a smile.  Endless flow of food and drinks!
To the housekeeping team- thank you for a clean and comfortable room to back to after the day's activities.  
Overall a great hotel to stay at , value for money and a sanctuary to relax in.","0","","NONE","2024-10-31","2024-11-04","2024-11-04","en","Hyatt Regency Amritsar","1182412","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303884-d1182412-r978726444-Hyatt_Regency_Amritsar-Amritsar_Amritsar_District_Punjab.html"

There website says it is 5 stars but having spent the last 17 nights in 8 different 4/5 star hotels this did not match up to any of them. The bedrooms were a bit shabby and could do with a makeover. The woodwork was scratched, beds were hard and the tea and coffee was short.  Breakfast service on the 2nd day was poor. I had to order my eggs benidict 5 times, it eventually came 40 minutes later with no bacon. The evening meal, on the Diwali festival, we had a candle on the table but it wasn’t lit, the same as other tables. There is no drink or food service around the pool. The bar being on a different floor and a good 2 minute walk away. On our way to the pool we notice a lady walking up and down with a young child. She was doing the same thing 2 hours later and we assumed she worked in the spa as that is where she was.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-11-01","2024-11-01","en","Hyatt Regency Amritsar","1182412","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303884-d1182412-r978294682-Hyatt_Regency_Amritsar-Amritsar_Amritsar_District_Punjab.html"

I mean that this is one of those hotels where you stay, have a perfectly acceptable time, with perfectly acceptable staff and perfectly acceptable food and it just merges into all the other Hyatts you have stayed in over the years. If you think about it, it must take a heck of a lot of training, managing and purchasing to get this sort of consistency but apart from the outside pool area you really could have been anywhere. WHile I applaud the management for producing a product so determinantly Hyatt I would have liked to have seen more of an Indian feel to the place, because after all, we were in India. Not Delaware.","0","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-10-29","2024-10-29","en","Hyatt Regency Amritsar","1182412","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303884-d1182412-r977121572-Hyatt_Regency_Amritsar-Amritsar_Amritsar_District_Punjab.html"

The Courtyard Marriott staff was unhelpful and unwilling to accommodate even minor requests. 

Having stayed at luxury hotels like ITC and Taj in India, I've come to expect a certain standard of hospitality. However, my experience at Hyatt Amritsar was a stark reminder that not all 5-star hotels live up to this standard.

Positive Aspects:

* The reservation staff was helpful and courteous.
* The staff at the front gate was polite and always willing to help.

Negative Aspects:

* Check-in: We were kept waiting for over 20 minutes for our room keys, and the staff seemed disorganized and uncoordinated.
* In-room Dining: The staff's tone was unprofessional and bordering on rude during our in-room dining requests.
* Checkout: The front desk staff's insistence on retrieving all room keys, even though they are just inexpensive plastic, was unnecessary and time-consuming. His statement that ""we can't check out until we have all the keys"" was, first of all, incorrect, but also the way he said it made it look like we were trying to steal them, ha! I have stayed 100s of nights in 5 star properties worldwide but this was one of the most insane things I have heard.
* Discriminatory Treatment: The staff's behavior towards foreign guests, particularly white European travelers, was noticeably different. They were less respectful towards Indian guests.
* Valet Attitude: The valet's comment about a short trip being unnecessary was odd and unprofessional. Perhaps they are underpaid or dissatisfied with their jobs.

Overall Impression:

While the staff at the entrance was polite and welcoming, the overall experience at Hyatt Amritsar was disappointing. The lack of coordination, unprofessional behavior, and discriminatory treatment were unacceptable. I would strongly recommend considering other options, such as Taj, for a truly luxurious and memorable experience. 

Hyatt Amritsar's management needs to pay closer attention to these details to ensure a truly 5-star experience. If you are not ready to go above and beyond to make your guests experience memorable, you are in the wrong industry.","0","","NONE","2024-10-31","2024-10-29","2024-10-28","en","Hyatt Regency Amritsar","1182412","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g303884-d1182412-r977071701-Hyatt_Regency_Amritsar-Amritsar_Amritsar_District_Punjab.html"
