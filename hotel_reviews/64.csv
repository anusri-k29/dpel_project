It’s big, clean, nice.

But- we where 2 nights and the ac didn’t work at warm position, it made cold wind

The solution of the hotel was a small mobile radiator (watch the photo)

But- when we asked to book a table for dinner, they told us that it’s all booked 3 weeks ahead, but they didn’t say that when we booked the room, long time ago

The pool is nice and so the sauna and the breakfast","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/42/63/6e/caption.jpg","COUPLES","2024-08-31","2024-08-25","2024-08-25","en","Hyatt Regency Perth","256464","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255103-d256464-r966651068-Hyatt_Regency_Perth-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html"

Location looks promising - near the river - but actually there are few decent views from the rooms, and as the local buildings are mostly apartment blocks there are few restaurants etc to find nearby. Good however if you have hired a car and need to park it overnight - underground parking is cheap for hotel visitors. It's a long walk to the city centre but there are free buses passing the hotel.","0","","SOLO","2024-08-31","2024-08-16","2024-08-16","en","Hyatt Regency Perth","256464","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255103-d256464-r965101457-Hyatt_Regency_Perth-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html"

I found it to be quiet and was able to relax. Bar and food options downstairs, with underground parking. Walking distance to some cafes. CAT bus or short walk into the CBD. River foreshore in less than 5 minutes walk. Can't comment on price, as was for work.

We caught the red cat bus for 5 mins which takes you straight to the Matagarup pedestrian bridge and you’re there! Perfect location. There are so many restaurant options in the East Perth area.

It's like something from 30 years ago. The breakfast was okay, but the chef was a bit funny. He called me bro and waved at me to ask me to replace a bowl of green onion on the buffet table, like I'm one of the staffs. Also, there was a condom on the floor in front of our room. Ridiculously funny that night.","0","","NONE","2024-08-31","2024-08-11","2024-08-10","en","Hyatt Regency Perth","256464","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255103-d256464-r964196171-Hyatt_Regency_Perth-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html"
