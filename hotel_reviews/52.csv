While I appreciated the upgrade to a suite, which was indeed lovely, I encountered several issues that detracted from my overall experience.

The main areas of the hotel, which I was looking forward to enjoying, were unfortunately closed throughout most of my stay. The Sunset Terrace was closed all day on both Monday and Tuesday, and although it finally opened on Wednesday, it was only after I had already left the hotel. Similarly, the Rooftop Panorama was closed every day, and on Tuesday night, when it was finally available, it was booked for a private cocktail reception, further restricting access.

Additionally, I had hoped to enjoy a beach or pool experience, but the hotel did not offer either during my stay, which was quite disappointing.

On a positive note, I would like to express my gratitude to the breakfast team. Fatlya, Clara Cruz, and Chef Kevin Samya were outstanding in accommodating my kosher requirements, and their service truly stood out as a highlight of my stay.

I hope you can take my feedback into consideration to improve the experience for future guests.

Thank you for your time and attention.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/c2/68/27/caption.jpg

From the view, to the tastes/smells we sincerely enjoyed our time along the Cote d’Azure. Each morning we were greeted by a smile and welcome at Scalini— by the second day the team knew which coffee to bring, how we liked our eggs prepared, and everything in between. After a long day exploring the coast, we enjoyed our favorite dinner of the trip right in our own hotel, as well. Highly recommended and grateful for a wonderful experience!","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-10","2024-10-10","en","JW Marriott Cannes","197829","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187221-d197829-r973309062-JW_Marriott_Cannes-Cannes_French_Riviera_Cote_d_Azur_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azur.html"

We booked the night before our arrival so we could get in the room when we landed in the morning and this worked out well.   We called a few times to make sure there was no confusion and our room was indeed available at 10 am.  The bed was comfortable.  The restaurant and bar in the hotel were expensive but it was a very good buffet breakfast and good coffee.   For parking, I made the mistake of parking myself in the garage.  It was easy to get in and find a spot, but getting out of the garage was an adventure.  I would recommend using the valet service.    Once you park, you won't need the car, as you can walk to the beach, all of the shopping, and a ton of good restaurants and hotel bars.  

The only negatives for this hotel:
1) The gym is terrible.  There are no free weight dumbbells.  There was one curl bar with a few small weight plates and a universal machine that had some disconnected cables.  There was only one elliptical and it was broken.  Really disappointing for a nice and expensive hotel. 
2) There is no designated beach area/restaurant on the beach associated with the hotel.  If you are not planning on going to the beach, then it's no big deal.  But if you are, it's easy with the hotels that have a designated area.","0","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-10-09","2024-10-09","en","JW Marriott Cannes","197829","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187221-d197829-r973241129-JW_Marriott_Cannes-Cannes_French_Riviera_Cote_d_Azur_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azur.html"

I strongly advise against choosing this hotel. Here are just a few reasons why:

	•	Terrible Customer Service: The staff shows no empathy or courtesy. They are unresponsive and lack the basic hospitality you’d expect from a hotel of this supposed standard.
	•	Outdated and Dirty Rooms: The rooms are old, poorly maintained, and simply dirty. It’s disappointing to see a lack of attention to cleanliness in a hotel of this category.
	•	Under Construction: There’s a part of the hotel under construction right in front, making the environment unpleasant and noisy, which ruins the experience even more.
	•	No Value for Money: For the price you pay, the quality and service are far below expectations. This is absolutely not worth it.

Overall, this hotel is not recommended. My stay here has been a frustrating experience, and I would encourage others to avoid it at all costs.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/a3/8a/06/caption.jpg

We were welcomed to a beautiful upgrade on a sea view suite (Marriott ambassador status). The front desk team was very friendly and knowledgeable when it came to where to go and what to do even on a Sunday evening. Special mention to John W. who went above and beyond to make sure our stay was flawless by replenishing the welcome amenities and making sure everything is on par. 
The hotel location is perfect right on Croisette and in front of the best beach clubs in Cannes.
