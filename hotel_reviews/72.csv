As a woman spending the day out alone, I felt safe and comfortable the entire time. I was very tired from my red-eye flight, so I was relieved that he was not overly talkative and trying to convince me to do things I had not requested from the start. He did have a couple suggestions that ended up being great- like the order that we visited places in and also in stopping to see the Victoria Terminal for a photo. He kindly walked me through the crowds to The Gateway of India and took photos for me. While walking, he stopped traffic and always made sure I was okay and had my phone put away and my purse zipped. I made several stops and he was always waiting patiently for me on the outside of shops, the spa and even my tattoo appointment! (Yes, this was a day out!). Bhanu drove safely, he knew when to chat and when I just wanted to relax and look out the window. He had water, soda, and mints for me in the car and made sure I was always comfortable with the temperature settings. If I was staying longer, I would find an excuse to hire him again. I am so glad I opted for a hotel car (so very reasonable in price and for the service, as well as convenience).","0","","BUSINESS","2024-11-30","2024-11-05","2024-11-05","en","Sofitel Mumbai BKC","2048980","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d2048980-r978778691-Sofitel_Mumbai_BKC-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html"

The front office staff is warm and will try to accommodate any request you have. The food is great and the natural fragrance in room and washroom is just soothing. Must visit place for either business travel or leisure stay! 

I had an accident where I slipped and glass fell on me- staff ( thanks to Mr.Santosh and team) was quick in action and gave all the medical support I needed. They made sure I feel comfortable and safe post the incidence and were checking on me regularly as I was solo traveler. 
Special Thanks to Mr. Nimesh & Mr. Mahadev- they both made sure I had a comfortable relaxing time post injury amd Mr.Nimesh were kind enough to arrange a hotel car for me to drop off to Airport and even arranged complimentary lunch in my room, kudos to such care! Thanks to general manager Mr. Manish Dayya for creating such a wonderful space and warm culture.","0","","BUSINESS","2024-10-31","2024-10-28","2024-10-28","en","Sofitel Mumbai BKC","2048980","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g304554-d2048980-r976981403-Sofitel_Mumbai_BKC-Mumbai_Maharashtra.html"

Large enough to get a table and yet no issues with impeccable service. The food spread as expected was perfect for lunch with everything freshly prepared. My fav.are the exquisite south Indian specialists and ""pani puri"" live counter. Ofcourse the dumplings and sushi are not to be missed. I specifically liked there seafood being ""responsibly sourced fish"" and the eggs for the dessert being ""cage free eggs"" . A nice touch committed to sustainability.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/de/dc/6a/caption.jpg
