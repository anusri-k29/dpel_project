We ate breakfast daily at La Rotonde' restaurant on property for a perfect start to the day. We also had a last meal at the beach restaurant La Plage du Negresco. The classic style and ambiance was fabulous!","1","","FAMILY","2024-06-30","2024-11-05","2024-11-04","en","Le Negresco","195659","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187234-d195659-r978732958-Le_Negresco-Nice_French_Riviera_Cote_d_Azur_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azur.html"

We rarely re-visit places, as we love to explore new locales; this hotel is so nice that we would consider a return in part due to how great Le Negresco was!","3","","COUPLES","2023-10-31","2023-10-12","2023-10-12","en","Le Negresco","195659","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187234-d195659-r920949237-Le_Negresco-Nice_French_Riviera_Cote_d_Azur_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azur.html"

It was almost perfect! The location is great for the old town, and to the train station to go to Cannes etc. We were greeted well by the staff at the door and, Charles after a difficult journey and were delighted with both our room with a view and I particularly loved the carpet on the hall floor. No time to watch tv- too busy exploring on our short break in the sun. The bar we found very relaxing and the staff amiable. Sometimes smart hotel staff have strange attitudes I find, but not here- people seemed to enjoy their work which is a credit to the management. Breakfast was the least smooth part of our visit- it would have been helpful on day one to explain the options, and one day the service was slow. However, as a good hotel we received an apology and a special refreshing drink so we were delighted. Mistakes happen after all. The concierge service was excellent, and Javier was a very helpful departure host. We hope to return at another quieter time in the Spring and perhaps try the spa. Worth the wait","1","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/f7/48/b7/caption.jpg

In addition to the very high quality and discreet service, regular little touches in our room, the hotel is a real home where everyone can feel comfortable and in which you can feel the artistic soul of Madame Augier, former owner.

The bedding and pillows are very comfortable. We walked through all the floors to admire the works of art, the gala hall is extraordinary with its canopy, its chandelier (the twin of which is in Saint Petersburg) and its works of art is simply magical. I had booked treatments at the new spa but a booking problem prevented us from enjoying it. However, we were able to enjoy the pool and sensory showers. A perfect romantic weekend.","1","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-28","2024-10-28","en","Le Negresco","195659","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187234-d195659-r976936885-Le_Negresco-Nice_French_Riviera_Cote_d_Azur_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azur.html"
