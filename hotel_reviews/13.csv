All of the staff here were amazing and they made my stay extra special!

If you have access to breakfast or the club, you’ll find the most patient and attentive staff.

We were here for 9 nights and every breakfast and club was bursting at the seams and there were a lot of rude guests, but the staff here handled everything with grace and a smile.

While the entire staff here was amazing, there were a few standouts.

When there wasn’t plant-based milk for coffee, Heba helped order soy milk for my partner because she is plant-based/vegan.  We were pleasantly surprised she would go through the hassle for us and even let us know when it arrived.

When my partner couldn’t find plant-based food, Queenie came out with samosas and daal that were vegan and weren’t available in the main self-serve area. 

Carol told her what she could eat and was super helpful when navigating the buffet.  Carol was the warmest, most nurturing chef we’ve ever come across.  She was very patient and was happy to accommodate any dietary restrictions in a way that felt like she truly cared about our well-being.  

The service here was phenomenal.

It’s usually difficult for my partner to find plant-based milk for her coffee and good plant-based food when we stay in Hyatts or other hotels.

In some cases, they make it feel like a burden or we would simply get a “no” when we asked for these things.

However, the staff at Hyatt Regency Dubai went out of their way to get soy milk, prepare plant-based/vegan food, and also ask the chefs what was vegan to make sure she didn’t accidentally consume butter, ghee, or milk.

The service here was as good as any Park Hyatt, Alila, or Andaz I’ve ever stayed at.","0","","COUPLES","2023-09-30","2023-12-21","2023-12-21","en","Hyatt Regency Dubai","306684","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d306684-r930500831-Hyatt_Regency_Dubai-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

The room was spacious with good storage facilities and a nice bath and shower. There is a good sized table but weirdly the kettle had to be moved from the refreshment area in order to find a plug. Plenty of hangers which is often lacking these days. On a more negative note the bed was uncomfortable and the pillows were very flat. Never had such poor pillows even in a budget hotel. We had lounge access which was excellent. Staff were attentive and there was a good choice of food for breakfast with an egg station. The evening free flow and buffet was also very good with a pasta station. The location of the hotel suited us because of business commitments but the nearest Mall was an hours walk away. It is on the Creek and interesting to see all the ships which we could see from the lounge.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-29","2024-10-29","en","Hyatt Regency Dubai","306684","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d306684-r977160789-Hyatt_Regency_Dubai-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"
