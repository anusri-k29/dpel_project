The Parmelia Hilton has easy access to the Convention Centre via an overpass. The Executive King Room in the hotel was modern and comfortable, with a table to work on and multiple power and USB points. The front desk, concierge and housekeeping staff were all helpful. The Executive Lounge was well appointed. The breakfast selection there, although limited was good.  The staff in the Lounge were particularly helpful in facilitating a breakfast meeting. There is also a good cafe onsite and an inviting pool area for downtime. Recommended.","0","","BUSINESS","2024-11-30","2024-11-01","2024-10-31","en","Parmelia Hilton Perth","255646","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255103-d255646-r978199230-Parmelia_Hilton_Perth-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html"

The rooms are very well maintained, last night was so quiet we wondered what was happening. It was a blissful nights sleep. Shower is excellent and amenities are exactly as you would need.
Breakfast was great as always. Our cars was bought around very quickly. We live 15 kilometers from the Parmelia but it is so worth it to stay there becuase of the staff. Thank you very much.","1","","COUPLES","2023-08-31","2023-08-26","2023-08-26","en","Parmelia Hilton Perth","255646","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255103-d255646-r912990968-Parmelia_Hilton_Perth-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html"

I was greeted by staff at the reception desk, and although I was a little early they worked on finding an available room for my stay. As one was not available, I was welcomed into the Executive Lounge to wait due to my Hilton Honors status. I was informed a message would be sent to me when the room was ready and my key could be collected from reception, and this occurred about 30 mins later. The room was large, clean and bright with a comfortable bed and soft furnishings. The living section room was modern, and looks like it had been refurbished within the last few years. The bathroom was also very large, with a dual sink and large shower. The bathroom however looks like it had been left out of the refurbishment, and was a little older than the rest of the room. It was starting to show signs of wear and tear, to a point where refurbishment is now required. That being said, it served its purpose well. I ordered room service through the online ordering system and it arrived within good time and was well presented, delivered by a friendly team member. 

The Executive Lounge was available to me for breakfast, and whilst simple was all I needed for the stay. On offer was the usual selection of hot dishes, cereals, breads and pastries with a self service coffee machine available along with teas, juices, water, and soft drinks. The Executive Lounge is well appointed and comfortable, it is a great offering at this hotel. Staff in the lounge were very friendly and helpful. I was advised at check in I could attend the restaurant for a small amount extra to upgrade my breakfast offering, but I opted instead to use the lounge and the offering was great. 

Around the Hotel: The hotel is located on Mill Street between Mounts Bay Road and St Georges Terrace. Close by (walking distance) is the Convention Centre and Riverside Theatre. There are cafes, restaurants and bars nearby, with a number located next door in Westralia Square. Fast food is available within a 10 min walk from the hotel on William Street. Shopping and supermarkets are also located about a 10-15min walk from the hotel.

Transportation: Trains run from Perth Airport to Perth City station (as well as from East Perth station if arriving by Indian-Pacific or the Prospector). From there you can either transfer to Perth Underground and ride one station to Elizabeth Quay and walk about 5-10 minutes to the hotel, or walk 15-20 minutes from Perth Station. The hotel is close by to the Elizabeth Quay Busport and the adjacent Elizabeth Quay Railway Station, and this can be accessed from the adjacent Westralia Square which has walkways linking the public transport facilities. Perth Busport is a 15-20min walk from the hotel and located adjacent to Perth Station. Valet parking is available on site, but I did not use this service, instead opting to arrive by train. 

This is a nice hotel with a great team who are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are modern and comfortable, albeit the bathrooms can do with a refurbishment. I enjoyed my stay and hopefully I will be able to stay here again on another trip to Perth.","0","","SOLO","2024-09-30","2024-09-09","2024-09-08","en","Parmelia Hilton Perth","255646","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255103-d255646-r968930017-Parmelia_Hilton_Perth-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html"

My staff booked 2 rooms for both of us on our business trip, direct booking under his membership with Hilton. Each room under one of us name and we arrived on different flight/time from Gold Coast and Sydney. 
When I checked in at hotel, reception staff and supervisor keep saying ""can't find my name"" but they found 2 rooms booked under my staff's name. Unfotunately I can't contact my staff at that time because my flight arrived earlier than him. Hotel staff keep me wait at hotel lobby for an hour even I told them I am very tired after a long flight 5,5 hours and I left my house at 3am. I wait and wait until 12 noon, no solution. They keep saying sorry and that's their policy (??) and they still can't find my name. I have to left hotel for our business lunch meeting at 12.30pm. When I am back at 3pm, they still not allow me checking in until they call my staff and verify his booking (he was visiting an agent). It's so frushstrated!! The way they solve problem is non of personal touch at all. I am working in hospitality for 17 years and 20 year in travel industry. I understand all policies but higher than policy it's human, it's personal touch and service from hearts. It's always has solution and never say NO to customers. I was there with all personal ID and credit card. I am not run away so they shouldn't treat me like that. 
Next day when we checked out, our staff talked to the girl name ALEXANDRA, this is the girl who's not allowed me to check in, he ask her why they couldn't find my name then she apology for the mistake (this is what my staff reported, I am not there with him). How' bad is this. I will never stay here again, sorry.","1","","BUSINESS","2024-06-30","2024-07-06","2024-07-06","en","Parmelia Hilton Perth","255646","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255103-d255646-r958224237-Parmelia_Hilton_Perth-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html"

Great food, staff that went well beyond what we expected. Best steak sandwich and salad in town. Easy walk from Elizabeth Quay station to get to airport by train. Well positioned for sightseeing although our purpose as locals was a night before an airport trip. Well recommended. Buffet breakfast was very good with lots of options - except strange sausage choice (cheese?) and worth booking the night before.","0","","COUPLES","2024-06-30","2024-06-24","2024-06-24","en","Parmelia Hilton Perth","255646","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255103-d255646-r956591727-Parmelia_Hilton_Perth-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html"

Friendly, always courteous and very empathetic when things like your booking goes a little awry.

Buffet breakfast had a great range of items and they were being regularly replenished.

Room service was very prompt - there is a $5 tray charge but I figure that’s reasonable for the relaxing experience of eating in your room","0","","BUSINESS","2024-05-31","2024-06-04","2024-06-04","en","Parmelia Hilton Perth","255646","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255103-d255646-r953780811-Parmelia_Hilton_Perth-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html"

The staff and room were excellent. Our meal at Samuel on Mill, before the show, was fantastic. We could not fault anything.

A wonderful, and affordable, combination.","0","","COUPLES","2024-04-30","2024-04-20","2024-04-20","en","Parmelia Hilton Perth","255646","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255103-d255646-r947550893-Parmelia_Hilton_Perth-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html"

Based on my Hilton experience from living in the US, I think it a four stars, not five stars as claimed. The room is not large, adequate size for a king bed, a desk and a small chair. Bed was little soft with decent bedding and pillows. Bathroom is dated, small with shower only. There is an inaccessible balcony looking down to the street.
The doors and walls are thin. You can hear noises from the hallway, the next rooms and the street.
The executive lounge is spacious and not too crowded. It serves hot breakfast and canapé in cocktail hours. If you want more selection for breakfast , as a gold member, you’d pay extra to eat at the main restaurant.
The personnel were professional looking and pleasant to deal with. The nearby location is lively with lots of restaurants. Busses going within the business area are free.","0","","SOLO","2024-03-31","2024-04-15","2024-04-15","en","Parmelia Hilton Perth","255646","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255103-d255646-r946872532-Parmelia_Hilton_Perth-Perth_Greater_Perth_Western_Australia.html"
