The bar at St. Regis offers a refined ambiance with comfortable plush seating and exquisite décor. I thoroughly enjoyed the live performance by two talented musicians, complemented by a curated cocktail menu and divine bites to complement, definitely an absolute perfect blend of sophistication and entertainment. A special thanks to Faysal for his excellent service and happy demeanour. Very special evening, one to always remember.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/fd/3a/44/caption.jpg

As a Marriott Ambassador member having stayed over 200 nights in Marriott hotels this year, St Regis the Palm is the best I’ve stayed in for a long time! 

Nothing is too much trouble. Staff super friendly. Can’t do enough for you. Butler service on point. Breakfast is amazing, staff very attentive. Kumari looked after us at breakfast for the 9 days we stayed and was exceptional. 

We had the most amazing room upgrade to a panoramic suite which was the icing on the cake. 

Honestly, amazing hotel, location fab if you’re looking for something outside of the beachfront hotels- you won’t be disappointed.","0","","FAMILY","2024-11-30","2024-11-01","2024-11-01","en","The St. Regis Dubai, The Palm","23274894","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d23274894-r978245928-The_St_Regis_Dubai_The_Palm-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

Rooms and location were great, but service was overall lacking and the staff are extremely judgmental.

Unless I was wearing my Sundays finest, I was treated with condescending attitude (all staff) and aggression (security).  No, I was not wearing shorts or tank tops, but simply casual which I prefer when I’m on vacation or after work. 

Security: I was hounded every time by security as if I didn't belong at the hotel (no, I don't have guests with me, this was a solo trip). I understand the importance of security at a 5 star hotel, however, l've stayed at almost every St Regis in the world and was never treated like a criminal.  Even if they didn’t recognize me, a simple greeting could do and a smile that I’m so fond of at the rest of the St. Regis brand. 

After a desert excursion, came back to the hotel and security just stared at me while I opened the door with my hands full. When did St Regis become the Courtyard?

Breakfast: Went two days in a row, barely acknowledged or serviced coffee while other ""rich"" looking folks were treated immediately. Frustrated both days and got up to get my own coffee and was scolded for doing it myself.

Checkout: Staff literally all stared at me while I
carried two suitcases and a bag while I checked out.  After I settled the bill, she just stared at me while l struggled to take my bags to my driver. Again, sorry I enjoy wearing comfortable clothes on a 15 hour flight? I had to correct the bill 3 times, she seemed like she was getting frustrated I was pointing out their errors?! 

Butler made no effort to do anything on this trip as well, don't even know who it was - they should learn from the St Regis in NYC.  

Worst St. Regis I have been to in the world due to poor service and cold staff. This review wouldn't make sense if it was any other hotel, but I paid for a high end hotel expecting top tier service and less judgment. If you're okay with location and decent room, go for it. If you don't want to wear a tuxedo and Rolex every day on your vacation or okay with no personable staff, stay somewhere else. 

Stayed +150 nights with Marriott this year, will not be returning here.","0","","SOLO","2024-10-31","2024-10-23","2024-10-23","en","The St. Regis Dubai, The Palm","23274894","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d23274894-r976397943-The_St_Regis_Dubai_The_Palm-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

Staying in the hotel solo, from my first minutes in the hotel I felt at home, my personal satisfaction and comfort their prime objective, with special mention to Butler, Suranga, who provided assistance throughout my stay, always welcoming me by name with a warm smile, happy to answer my questions, nothing was too much trouble. My room was light, spacious and very comfortable with white accents, the luxurious en suite included an ultra relaxing large free standing bath. The breakfast choices are extensive and fully compressive. I enjoyed the fresh half avocado option served with my egg choice and the coffee and beautiful patisserie deserve special mention. The welcoming and attentive restaurant team made a perfect start to my day whether this would be at their infinity pool or out and about at the beach club or elsewhere in Dubai. 
I found the hotel so conveniently located with direct internal access to the Nakheel Mall Dubai Palm and the palm monorail nearby. It is also situated below another of Dubai’s most popular visitor destinations, the Aura Sky lounge with 360 degree infinity pool giving the most stunning views of the Palm. 
The St Regis is an experience in itself whose collective team and their attention to every detail for your individual comfort and enjoyment, makes this so memorable and calls me back. Huge thank you to all the team.","0","","SOLO","2024-10-31","2024-10-08","2024-10-08","en","The St. Regis Dubai, The Palm","23274894","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d23274894-r973054141-The_St_Regis_Dubai_The_Palm-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

My biggest thank you goes to Toshali, the superr supervisor, for fixing my handbag’s zip while the room was made up & leaving me some bookmarks that I so badly needed! I’d also like to highlight Sarunga, Pascaline and Lina from the Butlers team and how well they took care of most of my requests (and I have to say I had quite a lot of requests!). Especially Sarunga who learnt my love for desserts & got me the most delicious macaroons & his recommendation of the classic bubble bath & chamomile tea really became the favourite part of my stay! 

Beyond the service which mattered the most to me, I did like the spacious rooms as well. A small improvement could be achieved with adding a beach bag/in house bag for guests to use for the beach/pool and those look pretty good as well. I wish I got a better view which would’ve made the stay absolutely perfect but I guess you don’t get everything in the first stay. Will surely be coming back here as soon as I need to take a moment away from the hustle of the city!","0","","SOLO","2024-09-30","2024-09-16","2024-09-16","en","The St. Regis Dubai, The Palm","23274894","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d23274894-r969992691-The_St_Regis_Dubai_The_Palm-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

The butler service was friendly and prompt, but it lacked the warm, personalized touch I’ve experienced at other St. Regis properties. It felt more like standard service than the signature luxury you expect from a St. Regis.

One of the big perks of this hotel is its direct access to Nakheel Mall, which was super convenient for quick shopping trips or dining options.

Now for the not-so-great part: the service was very inconsistent. The staff seemed poorly trained, and if you’re expecting the seamless, polished service typical of a St. Regis or similar 5-star hotels, you might be let down. For example, housekeeping accidentally took our daughter's soft toy, which wasn’t a big deal, but getting it back turned into an ordeal. The staff wouldn’t acknowledge their mistake and made us sign a form stating we lost the item, which was unnecessary and frustrating. A simple apology and maybe a small gesture like chocolates would’ve been more appropriate.

Another weird situation was trying to find out when the family pool closed. We got three different answers from three different people! When we finally made it to the pool with an hour left before closing, we were stopped by a host from the Ruya restaurant, insisting it was closed, even though it wasn’t. We ignored her and used the pool, but on our way back, she confronted us again. It was strange and uncomfortable—why is a restaurant host policing the pool?

One more issue was with the breakfast allergens. We have food allergies, and not only were the allergens not marked on certain items, but some were marked incorrectly. For example, pastries containing eggs weren’t labeled for egg allergens. This is a basic requirement at Marriott hotels worldwide, so it was concerning. The restaurant manager did update the labels after we pointed it out, but the initial disregard was worrying.

We did receive an apology from the manager on the last day, but overall, the service and operations here need serious improvement for the price they charge. Honestly, nearby properties like Grosvenor House, though older, offer much better service and make the experience here seem subpar by comparison.","1","","FAMILY","2024-07-31","2024-09-12","2024-09-12","en","The St. Regis Dubai, The Palm","23274894","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d23274894-r969456235-The_St_Regis_Dubai_The_Palm-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"
