So what’s changed ? There is no longer a personal connection with the staff who don’t remember your name and treat you as if they have just met you. There have been reductions in the number and size of toiletries etc and finally the technology in the room is very dated and badly needs upgrading - I could watch a rugby match on my phone but not in the room! 
Still love the place and plan to return again this year.  ","1","","NONE","2024-02-29","2024-02-19","2024-02-18","en","Jumeirah Burj Al Arab","302457","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d302457-r938838524-Jumeirah_Burj_Al_Arab-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

Afternoon tea is located on the 27th floor (the building height is equal to the 54th floor), elegant, high-end, and the view is very beautiful~
Then continue the tour of the hotel and take a shuttle to enjoy a hotel built on the Mediterranean island,
The hotel's historical museum and the retireed Presidential Suite (currently a museum), when you leave the beach sunrise is about to fall, great~~","24","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-m/1280/2d/e9/4f/97/caption.jpg

From the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out, the experience provided by the staff, as well as in the restaurants, was incredible. 

We enjoyed Sal and had dinner at Al Mahara, both with very pleasant and different cuisine. 

They were unforgettable moments and we hope to return one day to experience more like them.","0","","NONE","2024-10-31","2024-10-24","2024-10-24","en","Jumeirah Burj Al Arab","302457","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d302457-r976519825-Jumeirah_Burj_Al_Arab-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

Breakfast was two hours each, on the menu very delicious avocado brusquets, caviar fresh grained, cappuccino on different types of milk.  Today, on the day of departure, I had a special pleasure interacting with the waiter Sardabek - such people always decorate the time spent alone, sort of and breakfast doesn't seem so boring. 

Everything in the room is shiny, perfectly clean space, softest cushions. The elevator is fast, you didn't have to wait long. The staff is perfect, polite and courteous. 

It was three nights, before they got to the beach, by the pool comfortable, relax straight. At the water park, the queues aren't as big as at antlantis, there are a couple of coasters worth standing. Not all the restaurants have hit yet, there's a reason to come back. 

Thank you to the entire hotel team, this is a really beautiful place!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/e1/4e/28/caption.jpg","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-10-24","2024-10-24","en","Jumeirah Burj Al Arab","302457","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d302457-r976429567-Jumeirah_Burj_Al_Arab-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

Everything from start to finish is exceptional the staff go above and beyond in every way.
