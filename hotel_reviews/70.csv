We came at the Ritz last year and our experience was average. Upon arrival I was not given the room type I expected. Mr Dante Gonzalez from the Ritz took care of me….WOW, he over exceeded our expectations. I wish every Ritz had someone like him, professional, polite and making you feel he cares and guess what….he does!
Thank you Dante","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/e9/fe/3c/caption.jpg

However, at check in all I got was show me your ID by someone who I could barely understand.  Since I had 2 rooms I also gave her my husband’s ID but she said she didn’t need it and then 1 minute later asked me for the ID.  Incompetence at the hotel check in.","0","","BUSINESS","2024-10-31","2024-10-18","2024-10-17","en","The Ritz-Carlton Bacara, Santa Barbara","169676","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32438-d169676-r974343072-The_Ritz_Carlton_Bacara_Santa_Barbara-Goleta_California.html"

I have been staying at the Ritz for a long time and hundreds of nights with Marriott. I would not recommend staying at this hotel and honestly, I am giving up on the Ritz and Marriott due to the way they treat there elite members.

The property is lovely, but my room was dated and had peeling wallpaper. The people were nice. Schedule your bellhop ahead of time. I waited too long on my way out and after 10 minutes I just lugged my stuff myself - but it’s a big hilly property.  On day one, I was waiting on a room / was exploring and the bellhop left the luggage in the room, but left cards on my luggage and my backpack and just triggered some tip fatigue in me. One card would be fine. 

The property is a true expansive resort on the water. 20 minutes from downtown. About 40$ taxi from the airport, a bit less with a ride share. 

I see there are plans to renovate. Maybe then the price will match the room, but for now you’re paying for the property and the name.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/c3/03/0b/room-service-with-a-view.jpg","FRIENDS","2024-10-31","2024-10-11","2024-10-11","en","The Ritz-Carlton Bacara, Santa Barbara","169676","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32438-d169676-r973508851-The_Ritz_Carlton_Bacara_Santa_Barbara-Goleta_California.html"

The maid service was very good but the rest of the front desk or restaurants were inattentive and not interested in offering their services.  I was treated as if I didn’t exist. No extra effort was offered during my stay. It was unbelievable. For example I ordered my lunch and the waitress said she was going on her 30 minute break but the food will be out shortly.  It wasn’t.   At my dinners I would have like liked another drink but there was no help to make that happen.  I wanted to order another sushi roll but I had to wait. The restaurant wasn’t that busy at all. I called the hotel prior to stay to get a 2pm checkout as a Bonvoy member.  When I reminded the front desk of the arrangement he questioned me like I was a liar.  He asked who did I spoke with and when did I call, etc.  I asked for a 1:30pm checkout and he told me his compromise was 12:30.  I checked out at 12 noon but I was really disappointed with his response and approach. I was told that this hotel is an upscale hotel and they are not offered often. It is an expensive place to stay and normally all Marriotts are very good but this one doesn’t shine at all.","0","","SOLO","2024-10-31","2024-10-07","2024-10-07","en","The Ritz-Carlton Bacara, Santa Barbara","169676","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32438-d169676-r973012030-The_Ritz_Carlton_Bacara_Santa_Barbara-Goleta_California.html"

BUT : the fridge in the room is EMPTY ! No fresh drinks at all ! I'm not use to this, especialy when you pay a lot of money.  
I don't understand why not putting drinks and little snack , even if with have to pay this in extra. 
We only stay for 1 night so i can not judge about the service. 
The hotel become a little old, it needs a refreshment.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/2d/a0/fd/5f/caption.jpg

We stayed two night Thursday to Saturday and it was a perfect stay. 
The staff could not have been nicer. We had a suite near the pools with a partial view of the Ocean and it was outstanding! Getting around was easy , we took some shuttles uphill but mostly enjoyed the exercise.
We stayed on site the entire stay with the exception of a round of golf at Sandpiper next door. Once the hotel knew we were playing they arranged for complimentary transportation from our room in a golf cart, to a Ritz Suburban and a five minute drive over to the golf course. Incredible! They repeated the favor when we were done. 
We did the vigorous nature trail on a warm day, walked the beach and toured the property. We spent half a day at the pool closest to the ocean and did some laps in the pool, very nice and amazing staff around the pool.
We ate all of our meals at the hotel. The first night we ate at Angel and Oak, I left a separate review for that but it was impressive and the staff was great!! We ate both mornings outside at The Bistro and that was a great way to start the day, had one lunch at the pool and Makayla made it a perfect pool day. 
Highly recommend this resort if you are looking for relaxation .","0","","FAMILY","2024-09-30","2024-09-22","2024-09-22","en","The Ritz-Carlton Bacara, Santa Barbara","169676","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32438-d169676-r970922437-The_Ritz_Carlton_Bacara_Santa_Barbara-Goleta_California.html"

I was traveling with my wife and 6-week-old baby on our first trip to see our family in SB, and I am so glad we decided to treat ourselves on the way. Benjamin went out of his way to welcome us warmly after our long drive from SF and put us in a lovely room by the pool that was absolutely perfect! I’ve worked in hotel management and the hospitality industry for over 10 years and I wish I could hire him for my team in San Francisco! Our little one night trip was such a memorable experience thanks to Benjamin and we truly enjoyed every minute of the stunning pool, delicious food, comfortable bed, convenient golf cart rides, gorgeous ocean views, and friendly staff. Even the ambiance with calming music on the TVs when we arrived was magical! Thank you again, Ben, for making our first family trip one that we will never forget!","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/46/bf/95/caption.jpg

I originally called and spoke with Carla in Room Service on Sat 8/24 to send a special birthday treat to a friend who is checking in the next day to celebrate her birthday. I was having issues completing the e-form they sent via email, since I didn't have the confirmation number. Next day, day of birthday/arrival, I called again and spoke with Daniel. He resent the expired email link and gave me the confirmation number to fill out the e-form. On the form, I specifically indicated that I wanted a bottle of Prosecco, peach nectar (to make bellinis) and chocolate dipped strawberries. I also got the email address to their Guest Relations, Avelino, for them to type up a birthday message. I received an email from both Daniel and Avelino, assuring me that it will be delivered after they arrive. Avelino even said he just typed up the card and finished blowing up her balloons.

It's almost 11pm and I still have not heard from my friend about her birthday goodies. I texted her asking if she enjoyed them and to my surprise, she had no idea what I was referring to. She didn't receive anything. 

Monday morning, I called Avelino to ask him what happened? He said that my friend left a DND sign and they failed to leave a note under the door, but just left a voicemail. And we all know that no one really looks at the hotel phone! He assured me that everything will be delivered and apologized for the mishap. I reminded him again of what I ordered: a bottle of Prosecco, peach nectar (to make bellinis) and chocolate dipped strawberries.

Monday @2pm, my friend sent a photo of the goodies and NO PEACH NECTAR. And to top it off, the card message was from GUEST RELATIONS! It was supposed to be my personal message! So now it just made it seem like it was from Ritz, not me! 

This whole experience has been a major disappointment. This is NOT the type of service I had expected from Ritz Carlton. Totally unacceptable.","1","","FRIENDS","2024-08-31","2024-08-26","2024-08-26","en","The Ritz-Carlton Bacara, Santa Barbara","169676","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32438-d169676-r966928789-The_Ritz_Carlton_Bacara_Santa_Barbara-Goleta_California.html"
