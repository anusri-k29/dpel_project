Don't have any complaints about this hotel apart from two minor things.  According to the travel agent we used apparently, we were supposed to get breakfast when we arrived but we were told we couldn't. (didn't really matter that much) and our early wake up call for the morning of departure didn't happen and the bags didn't get taken down for us.   Luckily we had set an alarm and were quite capable of dragging our bags down so it didn't hinder us much.
I would quite happily stay here again if I was ever in Dubai again.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-11-03","2024-11-03","en","JW Marriott Marquis Hotel Dubai","3447941","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d3447941-r978587885-JW_Marriott_Marquis_Hotel_Dubai-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

Upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted by Abid with warm smile welcoming us who directed us to go ahead and check in, said they will bring our bags in; at the front desk was greeted by Lakisha with welcoming smile he went over how many nights we were staying, what daily chargers will occur like tourism tax what the cost would be upon check out once I don’t charge anything else to the room when my card would be charged, we told him we wanted good view and he delivered exceptional view that added beautiful memories to our trip he even mentioned that there was shuttle service available daily to Burj Khalifa .Santosh brought our bags up to the room along with Abid, they both were very knowledgeable and informative about places to visit and where to shop when asked, what was available in hotel. House keeper Yougesh believed did excellent job cleaning our rooms. Security men always pleasant. Whenever we were getting into our Uber Santosh, Abid or the other gentlemen available out there would always make sure we were getting into the right car. The outdoor pool layout and how it overlooks the city that such an amazing beautiful scenery. The General Manager of this hotel needs credit for managing an exceptionally professional team! JW Marriott left a memorable and lasting impression will definitely be using this name for future travels.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/fc/df/00/caption.jpg

We were in tower B which had lovely views over the lake. 

Our room was very spacious and kept clean everyday with fresh towels and bedding. The pool area is okay, quite small pool but food and drinks are good. 

The restaurants are lovely, we tried the steakhouse and the Indian both have excellent food and easy to book. We also had breakfast included, we went to kitchen6 few times which had a variety and also the cafe on the ground floor had lovely breakfast menu as well. 

The location is in the business bay which is located near the airport and burj khalfia. It is central but you have to get taxis everywhere, we used Careem a lot. 

The only negatives I have is my GHD wireless straighteners went missing, we did ask management and house keeping but no where to be seen. I had an emergency and was rushed away by ambulance and ever since that day I think housekeeping could have accidentally binned them but hotel couldn’t say. 

Overall a pleasant stay and I would possibly stay again but would rather stay at hotel with beach or bigger pool.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/f7/98/61/caption.jpg

From the check in and check out service, to the customer service, to the aura of the hotel - truly outstanding. Location is very ideal and right in the middle of Business Bay. They provide shuttles to Dubai Mall and back. Views are stunning from the rooms and the swimming pool area. Would like to recognize a few folks - M Ajmer Hossain and Jen De Leon who reached out to me before I even arrived and made the process flawless and smooth. They greeted me every time they saw me and made sure my family was taken care off. I also want to recognize Shaina Abdul Rajad from the front desk. Very courteous and respectful and always welcoming and checking to make sure everything was good. Also want to thank Insha, Tanisha  and Nahid from the Executive Lounge for their hospitality. And last but not least Arif and Kamrul from the Bell Desk - always opening cab doors, and welcoming us back. Making sure our luggage was transported and everything was to our full satisfaction. This hotel truly makes you feel special and definitely recognized me as their Platinum Member.","0","","FAMILY","2024-10-31","2024-11-01","2024-11-01","en","JW Marriott Marquis Hotel Dubai","3447941","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d3447941-r978259194-JW_Marriott_Marquis_Hotel_Dubai-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"

We, family of five, have ordered breakfast and taxi for our early check out for our departure to the airport.

No breakfast prepared, confusion at the checkout desk and long delays. No support getting expect chasing for a scam charge FIVE times higher than agreed and much higher anything we seen in Dubai.

Shame on you Marriott!!!","0","","FAMILY","2024-11-30","2024-10-31","2024-10-31","en","JW Marriott Marquis Hotel Dubai","3447941","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d3447941-r978194985-JW_Marriott_Marquis_Hotel_Dubai-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"
