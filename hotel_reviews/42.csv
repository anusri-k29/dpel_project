Rooms are small but well laid out 
Breakfast good 
Staff very kind and helpful 
When in Rome— a very good choice and the price “not crazy “ like some of the others in Rome.

We stayed in Albergo del Senato, for the 2nd time because personally, we belief this is the best hotel to stay in Rome.  We have never had a problem in this hotel.
My wife and I stayed 6 nights Apr. 19 - Apr 24, 2024 in a Superior double room (one of the highest floors - we could not get one with a balcony this time) with a wonderful window facing the Pantheon. The wonderful room, not too big but with a very comfortable bed, pillow and good size bathroom.  We booked it with buffet breakfast - delicious! and excellent service - you are treated as if you are the only one eating breakfast! 
The location IS the best.  Walking distance practically to every attraction.  We walked to the Coliseum and if you can walk and like to walk, you can even walk to the Vatican!  Location is incredible.
The staff is great, very helpful..  Recommended delicious restaurants including one right around the corner of the hotel we had the best pizza in the world! - assuming you like a thin crust.  Even free Limoncelo!  
Next time we visit Rome, we will definitely - without a doubt - stay in Albergo del Senato again.  
Recommendation:  
1.  We were able to get a better price booking the room using the Hotel's website.
2.  A taxi transfer from the airport (Fumicino) to the hotel is a flat rate of 50 euros if you follow the route dedicated exclusively to taxis AND cannot pay attention to anyone asking you to take you because it can become very expensive.","0","","COUPLES","2024-04-30","2024-10-18","2024-10-18","en","Albergo del Senato","191099","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d191099-r974428745-Albergo_del_Senato-Rome_Lazio.html"

The breakfasts were excellent.  They also provided us with recommendations for nearby lovely restaurants.  The hotel operations and the Staff were extremely thoughtful.  The rooftop bar overlooking the Pantheon, right across the street, was informal and great fun.","0","","FAMILY","2024-09-30","2024-10-17","2024-10-17","en","Albergo del Senato","191099","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d191099-r974292275-Albergo_del_Senato-Rome_Lazio.html"

As has been said the location is perfect and the staff was...well perfect. I already booked a room for my next stay in November. I was a bit concerned about the noise from the square in front of the hotel, but it wasn't an issue in the least.","0","","SOLO","2023-12-31","2024-10-08","2024-10-08","en","Albergo del Senato","191099","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d191099-r973088471-Albergo_del_Senato-Rome_Lazio.html"

Upon check in we were told that the city tax must be paid in cash ""6 Euros"" per person per night at checkout.  We knew about the city tax before traveling to Italy, so we were not surprised.  And in fact, the hotel in Florence that we stayed at also told us that it must be paid in cash/Euros at checkout. So upon check out we paid the 24 Euros in cash and the front desk clerk (gentleman) gave us a receipt. Of course, the receipt for the transaction was in Italian but regardless, I still had a receipt.  Upon returning home, I was doing my on-line banking and realized that the hotel had also charged my debit card $26.81 for the city tax.  I contacted the hotel and they told me that I did not pay ""Euros"" upon checking out and that I gave them my credit card to charge this to.  I never gave the front desk my credit card, they had this on file from when we pre-paid for our room.  We went back and forth with no resolution, other than them charging me twice.  Note, the hotel had a totally different receipt on file than what was given to me.  Regardless after four days of back and forth e-mails, they will not reverse the charge.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-02","2024-10-02","en","Albergo del Senato","191099","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d191099-r972333933-Albergo_del_Senato-Rome_Lazio.html"

We had a perfect view of the pantheon and enjoyed people watching drinking cocktails at night.   There were always street musicians and performers & most of the restaurants were affordable and delicious.  Everything was within walking distance and the taxi stop is right on the other side of the pantheon.  There is a grocery store close by for any amenities and we bought a lot of souvenirs (like pasta and salts) here. The staff was very helpful.  I was taking a cruise and forgot to print my tags and they helped print them for me no problems at all.  They also arranged a pick up for us at the airport which worked out perfectly!! Highly recommend as my parents didn't get a pick up and they had to wait an hour for a taxi.  The room was very nice and larger than we expected considering european rooms are typically small. We disliked the twin beds stuck together situation as they kept sliding apart but we managed.  You can easily walk to a lot of places including Trevi fountain and the Chiesa di Sant'Ignazio di Loyola (dont miss this!!) .  We 100% recommend and will stay here again!!","0","","COUPLES","2024-08-31","2024-09-11","2024-09-11","en","Albergo del Senato","191099","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d191099-r969343750-Albergo_del_Senato-Rome_Lazio.html"

They were good enough to give us a room with a Pantheon view which was a great spot to watch the ebb and flow of the crowds. 
The room was comfortable and the air con good ( since it was a humid 30 degrees when we were there). 
All of the staff were helpful and friendly including making a restaurant booking for us by phone when we couldn’t do it online. 
Its rooftop bar ( with a bartender from 430 pm) is a brilliant place for guests to see the city views, it had a bit of a cooling breeze and made some excellent drinks. 
We look forward to returning.","0","","COUPLES","2024-09-30","2024-09-10","2024-09-10","en","Albergo del Senato","191099","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d191099-r969116023-Albergo_del_Senato-Rome_Lazio.html"
