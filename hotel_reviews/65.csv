We couldn’t have been more delighted with our decision to stay at this hotel. 

The entire property, the rooms, the service, the restaurant, and even the live Entertainment in the lounge were memorable and top class, even In comparison to other pier, hotels across Europe, where we have stayed.","0","","COUPLES","2024-03-31","2024-10-20","2024-10-20","en","Hotel Danieli Venice","194256","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d194256-r974635146-Hotel_Danieli_Venice-Venice_Veneto.html"

Enchanted the moment you enter through the door. The former palace hotel has been amplified with additional buildings. But the main building is incredibly beautiful. High ceiling, stylish decoration. Great with lobby and bar. 
You might feel like you’re in a story or movie scene. 

The bar is absolutely delightful. There''s a live piano at the bar every evening. Cocktails were successful. Breakfast is at the restaurant on the terrace with a great view. The breakfast buffet was quite successful. 

The staff is very professional. 
The rooms are comfortable and impressive. 
Apart from the absence of a coffee maker , they were pleased with the mini-bar ingredients and champagne treats .

The room with a canal view balcony was fantastic. We didn’t want to leave the room.","0","https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2d/d3/07/6b/caption.jpg

No tea pot, no coffee maker in the rooms
Vacuum cleaner in the hallway, like it's decoration 
Lousy restaurant service
Picture of regular buffet, no a la carte menu
It is still IDENTICAL to 30 years ago, it is important to preserve the classic but maintaining what does not happen. The installation of light is pathetic, a little and they put candles...
Bathroom door frames and mirror are plastic
Bathroom packaging has mushrooms
It looks like a very old people's hotel because at 5.30pm you're already knocking on the door for the turn down

The amenities are from Acqua di Parma and the slippers are Frette which is quite appreciated

In conclusion, there is not a sliver of cost-benefit ratio, it feels cheap for excessive cost.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-11","2024-10-11","en","Hotel Danieli Venice","194256","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d194256-r973473304-Hotel_Danieli_Venice-Venice_Veneto.html"

He did not offer any assistance with helping us in, and then continued to loudly ask what we wanted, in front of other guests and staff. 
Shocking. 
When we went to take photos of the gorgeous reception, he arrives breathing down our neck. 
I asked if this was ok, to which he just glared. 
Other groups of aisan tourists arrived taking photos and he did not bother them or storm up asking what they were doing. 
Some welcome. 
I would never stay here again purely as this man is so rude and obviously does not even like people being in what he sees as his hotel. 
It’s the guests who pay the wages, so perhaps treat us a little more politely, or dare I say, just like a decent human being. 
We went on to stay at a far more superior and expensive hotel, where the welcome was gorgeous and everyone was made to feel welcome and at ease. 
I would not recommend this hotel, perhaps if this man was to leave then possibly. 
Really tainted the excitement to our long awaited holiday.","0","","COUPLES","2024-10-31","2024-10-04","2024-10-04","en","Hotel Danieli Venice","194256","https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d194256-r972525702-Hotel_Danieli_Venice-Venice_Veneto.html"
